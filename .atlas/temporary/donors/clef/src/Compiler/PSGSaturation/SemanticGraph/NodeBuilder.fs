/// reachable via children for the traversal algorithms (SSA assignment,
/// reachability) to work. That relation is now defined once, in `kindEdges`,
/// and this is its `EdgeClass.Structural` projection -- it cannot drift from
/// the reachability projection in Reachability.fs, because both read the same
/// table. Reference edges (a VarRef's definition) are deliberately excluded:
/// a definition is related to a reference, not contained by it.
