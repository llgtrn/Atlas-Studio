///
/// Every reachable integer value carries its analysed range as a coeffect beside its type
/// (`SemanticNode.ValueRange`), every record type carries the join of each field's range over its
/// reachable constructions (`SemanticGraph.FieldRanges`), and every array element type the join of
/// every value stored into an array of it (`SemanticGraph.ElementRanges`). The width is derived
/// from the range wherever it is read (`ValueRange.width` on fabric; on a core the selected declared
/// representation, `selectedWidth`, derived on read from the range and the platform's declaration)
/// and is never stored beside it (Horizon C3).
///
/// The pass is a least fixed point over an immutable `Map<NodeId, ValueRange>`: a transfer
/// function per node kind (§1.1 seeding, §1.2 propagation), iterated to a post-fixpoint with a
/// widening operator whose thresholds are the declared integer representations' boundaries
/// (numeric-selection.md §9.1; on fabric, which declares none, an endpoint that keeps growing goes
/// to its infinity), then a bounded narrowing that recovers the precision the widening gave up
/// (§1.2a). A comparison bounds the branch it guards: a reference to the compared binding inside
/// the then-subtree carries the binding's range met with the bound, and inside the else-subtree the
/// complement (§1.1, "a comparison bounds the branch it guards"); the per-node range is what makes
/// that representable, since a reference under a guard is its own node.
///
/// The declared sources (§1.1 last bullet, CS-11) are read from one table beside the intrinsic
/// definitions (`Intrinsics.RangeSources`): an intrinsic result's fact, the interim declared
/// boundary of a width-named carrier, and what a higher-order intrinsic supplies to the function
/// it is handed. A call through a function value (a parameter, a closure, a partial application)
/// reaches every lambda that escapes as a value and whose parameters may unify with the call's
/// arguments, and its arguments join into those lambdas' parameters; a parameter no seen call
/// supplies is unobservable and its CCS8011 names the escape.
///
/// A reachable integer whose final range has no width is CCS8011 (§1.3, §7): an error on fabric,
/// where the width has no other source, and information on every other substrate while the
/// migration inventory is open (CS-11 slice 3 records the residual). A bounded range of the bare
/// kind that no declared integer representation covers is CCS8012, a warning promoted by
/// `--warnaserror` (§4.2). Runs on every substrate, over reachable nodes only, after the declared
