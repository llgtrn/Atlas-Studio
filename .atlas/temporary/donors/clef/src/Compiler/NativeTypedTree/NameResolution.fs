/// Compositional Name Resolution for CCS
/// 
/// This module implements name resolution as a codata/coeffect pattern:
/// - Resolvers are functions from names to bindings (demand-driven)
/// - Open declarations compose resolvers (functional composition)
/// - BCL is structurally impossible (BCL bindings never added)
/// 
/// Key insight: Instead of accumulating bindings in a mutable map,
/// we compose resolver functions. Each `open` declaration adds a new
/// "lens" that tries prefixed lookups before falling back.
