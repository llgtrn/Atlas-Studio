## The settled position, in one table

### September 19 documentation reconciliation

The February `SMT_Integration_Strategy.md` was retired after a full-content
review. Its graph-obligation and checking material is superseded by Composer's
`Obligation_Residency_Design.md` and `Proof_Composition_Architecture.md`, and by
this directory's dimensional design/handoff and `Lattice_Consumer_Contract.md`.
The documentation index now points to those sources; no separate February
implementation sequence remains in force.

The invented permission coeffect and source escape context in
`From_FSharp_to_Clef.md` §§5–6 were removed. Platform operations participate in
Clef's ordinary memory, lifetime, access and proof judgments. The same correction
removes deprecated binding stubs, fabricated coeffect-arrow syntax and promised
ownership/borrowing annotations from that guide. The specification's array
bounds wording now states the unconditional obligation, and its dangling-view
example requires valid placement or a diagnostic. See `behavior-classification`,
`platform-bindings`, `memory-regions` and `conformance` in `clef-lang-spec/spec/`.

### Earlier settled decisions

| Concern | Retired form | Settled form | Where settled |
|---|---|---|---|
| Delimited continuations | a `cont.*` / `dcont.*` op surface; a DCont dialect; `ContStateMachine` as a Composer coeffect | the suspension recipe: segments at cuts, a frame (environment node, state-machine slot class), a delimiter edge per cut; witnessed as a discriminant, byte frame, `scf.index_switch` | spec `dcont-representation.md` §2, §5, §6, §9; `Delimited_Continuations_Architecture.md` |
| Interaction nets | an Inet dialect | hyperedge rule structure over enumerated source sets; witnessed as data flow | `program-hypergraph.md`; `Single_Flattening_Design.md` §4 |
| Closures | `memref<2xindex>` index pair + `builtin.unrealized_conversion_cast`, resolved by the `resolve-closure-casts` plugin; a `code_ptr` word inside the environment | the pair `(fn, env)` — `func.constant` + `memref` — never packed, never cast, no function address stored as data; pathways consume it with standard lowerings | spec `closure-representation.md` §2.1, §6.3, §10.1; `backend-lowering-architecture.md` §2.2, §4, §7.1, §7.5; C-01 §14.3 |
| Lazy and seq | `{computed, value, code_ptr, …}` / `{state, current, code_ptr, …}` with the thunk / MoveNext address at slot `[2]` | `(thunk, {computed, value, captures})` and `(moveNext, {state, current, captures, internal})`; captures begin at `[2]` | spec `lazy-representation.md` §3, §4, §8, §11; `seq-representation.md` §4, §5, §8 |
| Seq state machine | `flattenSequentials` / `splitAtYield` two-shape recognizer; `cf.switch`/`br` MoveNext; `WhileBasedMoveNextInfo` | segments at `yield` by the suspension recipe; `scf.index_switch` | `seq-representation.md` §5.2, §6 |
| Witnessed vocabulary | `func, cf, scf, arith, memref, index, builtin` | `func, scf, arith, memref, index` — five, no other; `cf.*` is produced by the pathway's `scf` lowering; admission of a further dialect is a change to the table first | `backend-lowering-architecture.md` §2.1, §7.1 |
| Stack switching / WAMI | "Alex → WAMI dialects"; "DCont-via-Coroutines vs DCont-Native strategies" | two backend realizations of one witnessed form: the state machine as written, or a backend leg transliterating frame + discriminant into the proposal's `cont.*` instructions | `dcont-representation.md` §5.2; `wasm-targeting/README.md` Axis 2 |
| Numeric width | width-named types (`int8`…`uint64`, `byte`, `uint`, `nativeint`, `float32`, `Posit32`), width suffixes (`1L`, `1uy`), a Tier-3 "seal", an explicit-conversion form with a wrap/saturate discipline | one integer kind `int` and one real kind `float`, each with a dimension; the analysed range selects the width or representation from what the platform declares; intended loss is arithmetic (`%`, `clamp`, the rounding functions, `float`); a boundary is a declaration the compiler reads and checks for coverage (CCS8012) | `Dimensional_Range_Design.md` §0 (D10); `width-inference.md` §7; `numeric-selection.md` §3.3, §5; `ntu-types.md` |

| `seq-operations-representation.md` | wrapper layouts with `code_ptr` at `[2]`; `llvm.*` listings presented for the creation and invocation forms | pair form; `code_ptr` rows removed and reindexed; §5.1/§5.3 listings rewritten over `memref`/`func` (known-callee direct call; the function-value-parameter case named as the retooling plan's open placement decision); §6.1, §9.1, §10.3–4 repointed |
| `expressions.md` lazy note; `platform-bindings.md`, `incremental-computation.md` dialect lists | struct-pointer thunk convention; seven-dialect list with `cf`/`builtin` | pair form; five dialects |

## Category (b) — stale claims that read as current  *(edited)*

`MLIRNanopass.fs` header and `applyPasses` docblock; `WebView_Desktop_Architecture.md` regime table; `C-04-CoreCollections.md` §15; `QuantumCredential/…/C-01-SCF-Parallel-Pattern.md` (banner; "Custom Dialect Requirements" and Phases 3–5 replaced by retirement notes; "defers" table repointed; decision record kept as history); `wasm-targeting/README.md` Axis 2 rewritten and five further lines; `wasm-targeting/03` two paragraphs; `javascript-targeting/README.md`; clef `ccs-specification.md` §12.6 retitled "Suspension and Nets on the PSG"; `Partial_Application_Closure_Reification.md` pair line; `PRDs/C-07-SeqOperations.md` inventory line marked interim; ship-of-theseus `scaffold/qa-preparation.md` rehearsed answer re-voiced ("prior art I learned from, not a dependency" — **review the voice**); site `coeffects-and-codata.md` WAMI section, `gaining-closure.md` §"The Witnessed Form" and LLVM realization rewritten to the pair form, `dcont-inet-duality.md` and `delimited-continuations.md` supersession sentences marked; blog `abstract-machine-model-paradox.md` (dated 2025-09-05) given an editor's note and three "prior art" qualifiers rather than a rewrite — **review**.

## Category (d) — stale since Increment 1  *(edited)*

`PSG_Nanopass_Architecture.md` roadmap (hyperedges landed; closures next; suspension/nets mid-term); `Coeffect_Analysis_Architecture.md` (third class: hyperedge enrichment over $F$; yield-state row marked interim); `CCS_Architecture.md` (three rows added; honest status line on which coeffects CCS computes today; layer table).

## Sample applications are corpus

Sample applications that "express" a capability (Composer `samples/`, the FidelityHello set, HelloProof and the rest of ship-of-theseus) are swept by the gate on the same terms as the spec. A sample that teaches the retired shape — a cast-plugin closure path, a two-shape seq, a doc line promising a dialect — is revised, not preserved as an exhibit. Sample intermediates and expectations that pin the cast form are on the scheduled list and move with the witness.

## Waypoint — interaction-net annihilation

Held as a bearing while the resumption-edge class and the RPC wait-for edge are designed, not as work scheduled now. Annihilation is the one rewrite in the Baker inventory that *removes* structure, and the hypergraph's second invariant (monotone saturation) admits no deletion. So it must be grounded as a fold-in consequence: the active pair's hyperedge fires on its complete two-member source set, both agents move to *Latent* under the DTS/DMM three-state model, and the auxiliary ports are connected pairwise as new edges. Nothing is deleted; the graph is monotone in annotation and the reduced structure is the consequence. This is the same $|S_f| = 2$ pairing shape the η/ε twin and the synchronous-RPC wait-for edge use — one pairing mechanism, three instances — which is why the continuation design should be checked against it as it comes together. Lessons from the retired dialects are measured in this frame only.

## Category (a) — already record the supersession  *(allow-listed in the gate)*

`Thin_Middle_End_Design.md`, `Delimited_Continuations_Architecture.md`, `Single_Flattening_Design.md` — the superseding designs, which quote the retired vocabulary in order to retire it and define the one place it survives (below the boundary, as transliteration). `Witness_Boundary_Audit.md`, this register, and the plans beside it.

## Category (e) — external references  *(no action)*

Papers and posts citing CMU's and Coll's dialects as research context: PHG paper §1.4, `flight-qualified-bytecode`, `doubling-down-dmm-dts`. Accurate as history; the gate's marker rule ("prior art") admits them.

## The pointer crutch — `nativeptr`, `code_ptr`, `!fidelity.*`

Raised as the same drift seen from the language surface: `FSharp.NativeInterop`'s `nativeptr` was the early crutch that made three retired forms easy to write — the environment reached through a raw address (`ptr<Lazy<T>>` struct-pointer passing), the code reached as address-as-data (`code_ptr` in the environment), and by-reference captures typed `ptr<T>`. The spec already holds the position (`ffi-boundary.md` §1: interior Clef has no raw pointer type; `Ptr<'T, 'Region, 'Access>` is the interior handle, `CHandle<'T>` the boundary handle; commit 8768e536e strips the surface, `TNativePtr` compiler-internal). This changeset carries it through:

- **Spec**: by-reference captures are `memref<1xT>` views (closure-rep §2.2); thunks and `MoveNext` receive their environment (lazy §4, seq §5); `NTUfnptr` is a `func` value (`ntu-types` §8.1); extern symbols are `func.constant` (`ffi-boundary` §3.2); the `!fidelity.*` MLIR columns in `native-type-universe` and `native-type-mappings` — the residue of an abandoned custom type dialect — map to the standard forms the representation chapters fix (`memref<?xi8>` strings, `memref<Exi8>` records/unions/options, `index` links, `(fn, env)` closures, `(A) -> B` functions).
- **Design docs** (clef, Composer, site): buffer parameters are the bounded stack array `platform-bindings` §57 prescribes; `stackalloc<T> n`; `Ptr.ofAddress` for declared peripheral regions; `CHandle<'T>` in extern declarations; the feature audit's `NativePtr.*` rows marked stripped with their replacements; the "strings are fat pointers" claim corrected (a string *is* a `memref<?xi8>`); the `async.func`/`!fidelity.*` and "hypothetical seq dialect" sketches replaced by the witnessed form.
- **Bannered, reported-not-failing**: implementation PRDs (surface note); Farscape's generated-code sketches (move with the generator); dated blog posts (editor's note); the inherited F# compiler test corpus under `clef/tests/`; BAREWire's .NET-side docs (NativeInterop is legitimate there).
- **Collections (map, set, list) — decided and rewritten (2026-09-04).** The chapters represented the empty collection as a null pointer and links as `ptr<…>`; both are retired. Settled form: a link is a bounded arena-relative `index` (VC-LINK: 0 ≤ i < extent(arena), QF_LIA); the empty collection is the zero-slot environment node placed statically — one immutable **sentinel image** per element type residing in the platform's declared immutable program-lifetime space (rodata / flash / constant memory / initialised BRAM; never "Flash" as the general term), cited by a `Resides` edge (VC-RES) — and every arena hosting that node type carries the sentinel at **offset 0**, initialised from the image, so links are plain offsets, `0` is the sentinel, and no read selects between buffers (no absence branch, no redirect at the witness). `empty` is the index literal 0; `isEmpty` is a literal comparison (`height = 0` / `tag = Empty`); the sentinel slot is `ReadOnly` (VC-RO, diagnostic CCS8020); reads of payload slots are dominated by the discriminant test (VC-GUARD). All four obligations are quantifier-free at saturation; the AVL invariant and the list algebra are schema lemmas per recipe shape. The lowercase `ptr<…>` notation is retired spec-wide (DU eliminator signatures, NTU layout boxes included) and the gate enforces it.

## Decisions taken in the collections rewrite (for review)

- **Offset-0 realisation.** The audit left the sentinel as a static node reached by a distinguished index outside the arena; that reintroduces a buffer-select at every link read. Resolved as: image static, copy at offset 0 of each hosting arena (one node per arena, `memref.copy` at creation; static initialiser for static-backed arenas). VC-LINK loses its disjunct.
- **Diagnostic numbering.** The spec's access-kinds chapter numbers the ReadOnly-store diagnostic CCS8020; clef's `ccs-specification.md` Appendix D carried the FS8xxx series until the file was retired on 2026-09-04 (a parallel spec, a drift source); it Disposition of that file's parts on retirement: Parts 1–11 duplicated spec chapters; Part 12 (ownership, marked FUTURE) and Part 12 (SCF regions and traversal: `foldWithSCFRegions`, `VarBindings`, `BeforeRegion`, none of which exist in clef or Composer) were retired traversal design; Part 13 (pattern-matching compilation) described the same retired traversal around the live `PatternBinding` and `MatchCase` node kinds, whose design of record is `PSG_to_PHG_Plan.md` and PRD F-05; Part 14 (collection HOF decomposition, shadow AST) was the INTERIM Baker decomposition that the collections decision above replaces. Two parallel copies of NTU chapters (`native-type-universe.md`, `NTU_Type_System.md`) were retired with it; their unique sections were Alloy shadow types, an `fsni` REPL and a migration sequence, all vestige. series (FS8002 for the same message). The chapters cite CCS8020. The two series should be reconciled; not done here.
- **One-arena invariant.** Structural sharing is index aliasing within one arena, stated normatively (map §7, set §6, list §7): every node reachable from a value across its persistent versions lives in the arena of its origin, so a derived version cannot classify to a longer lifetime than that arena.
- **Precondition failures.** `List.minBy`/`maxBy` on the empty list use `failwith` in the decomposition; whether an unguarded user-level `List.head []` is rejected at compile time under VC-GUARD or is a defined failure is open (verification findings below decide the wording).
- **Terminology.** "sentinel node" (representation-level, this design) vs. the pejorative "sentinel values" for API-level −1/null returns in `native-type-universe` §1; the latter is being reworded.

## Second sweep — pointer vocabulary beyond the collections (2026-09-04)

`discriminated-union-representation.md` (a DU value is a `memref` view of its `{tag, payload}` block; nested and recursive payloads are `index` links into one shared arena; eliminators take the view; §6.1 match lowering over `scf.index_switch`; pathway listings labelled as such), `native-type-universe.md` and `native-type-mappings.md` (strings `memref<?xi8>`, arrays `memref<?xT>`, no `{ptr, len}` header; list/map/set rows on the sentinel; Sram/Flash generalised to the declared program-lifetime spaces; "sentinel values" reworded to avoid the clash), plus the single-line residue in `introduction`, `lexical-analysis`, `interactive-development`, `types-and-type-constraints`, `special-attributes-and-types`. `platform-bindings.md` gains **§Program-Lifetime Spaces**: the descriptor designates by name exactly one immutable and at most one mutable program-lifetime space, `Resides` cites the name, fabrication is forbidden (Conformance §6), absence is a compile-time error, and the managed-substrate profile discharges residence by carrier realisation. `program-hypergraph.md` §6's platform-description citation is repointed there.

Open decisions surfaced by this sweep, for you:

- **In-aggregate footprint of a `memref` view.** The chapters' byte totals assume a string/array field occupies two platform words inside a record or DU block. Recommendation: settle it as exactly that — a base `index` into the declared space plus an `index` extent — and never the five-word MLIR descriptor, which is a pathway artefact, not a layout. If accepted it is a BAREWire-describable field; if not, every byte total in the NTU chapters needs re-deriving.
- **Constructor return for arena-placed DU values.** The DU chapter's constructors return the view and state that the block's arena-relative offset is its `index` link; the collection chapters' constructors return the index. Aligning DU constructors to return the index would let a parent node take the child link without an offset computation.
- **Arena descriptor shape.** `native-type-universe` §8.4 still draws the arena as `{Base: nativeint, Capacity, Position}`, which is address-shaped, while the DU chapter passes an arena as `memref<?xi8>`. `memory-regions.md` owns this; the memref-plus-position form is the consistent one.
- **Region naming.** `memory-regions.md` defines Stack, Arena, Peripheral, Sram, Flash; the descriptor prose uses Text/Data/Heap. The program-lifetime-space roles are now named by the descriptor, but the region vocabulary itself should be unified across targets.
- **Nested non-recursive DU payloads** are kept as `index` links per the chapter's prior implication; inline embedding is possible now that a nested block's extent is settled at saturation and would change the `Container<Number>` row from one word to the nested block's size.

## Verification of the collections rewrite (2026-09-04)

Three adversarial lenses (consistency and references, decidability and proof soundness, residual absence semantics) over map/set/list and the chapters they cite; 58 findings applied. What they changed:

- **Obligations are now argued, not asserted.** VC-LINK is stated per link *store site* (operand is the literal 0, a bump result bounded below by the arena floor and above by `Position + sizeof(node) ≤ Capacity`, or a loaded value that inherits its store's discharge), never per link word; VC-GUARD is per read site (the arm of a match on the same SSA value, or, for the rotations, a QF_LIA entailment from the balance-factor test); VC-RO is structural (every store is emitted by `node`/`cons` at a bump result at or above the floor), with CCS8020 covering only a store through a `ReadOnly` view of the image. Arena identity of an `index` value is a saturated annotation, so the extent *E* is a literal.
- **Arena floor.** `memory-regions.md` now defines the floor: an arena hosting collection nodes carries the (all-zero) sentinel slot at offset 0, `Position` starts at the floor, `alloc` never returns below it, and `reset` returns to the floor, never to 0. The arena layout is `{Base: index, Capacity: index, Position: index}`, a buffer view plus a cursor, not an address.
- **No trap on empty.** `List.minBy`/`maxBy`/`head`-class applications carry no synthesised `[]` arm with a failure branch (that is a null check under another name and makes VC-GUARD vacuous); an application whose argument's tag is not dominated by the program's own test is diagnosed at design time. `Map.find` is different: its failure is a match on an option value.
- **`remove` supplied** for map and set in sentinel form (deletion is where a null-based AVL returns "no node"); `setLeft`/`setRight` defined as path-copy placements; `cons` places the new node in the arena of its tail; the one-arena invariant carries its lifetime implication (the arena's class is the join over derivation edges; a join with no home is the DU §8.2 lifetime error, never a cross-arena link).
- **Working assumption applied corpus-wide:** a string or array field inside an aggregate is two words, base `index` plus `index` extent (the boxes now read `{base: index, extent: index}`); the byte totals in the NTU chapters were left as they were on that assumption. Confirm or the totals need re-deriving.

## The pre-NTU/PSG naming — FNCS, "F# Native", fsnative, FSNAC, Firefly (2026-09-04)

Retired as a vocabulary family: the product is Clef, the service is CCS, the type universe is NTU, the graph is the PSG, the compiler is Composer. The gate fails on any of these names outside the places listed below. What the sweep removed from clef, all staged for review:

- **The inherited test corpus** (`tests/`, 8,575 files, 18 trees). None was in `Clef.Compiler.Service.sln`; every external reference was an inherited dotnet/fsharp artefact. The one CCS-named project (`FSharp.Native.Compiler.Service.Tests`) was the FCS service suite plus three CCS-era files that open namespaces which no longer exist. The *intent* of those three — `Primitive Types per Spec`, `BCL Rejection per Spec`, `Option Type per Spec`, `Name Resolution per Architecture`, `Metaprogramming per Spec`, `Quotations as Memory Mapping Carriers` (`SpecDrivenNativeTypeTests.fs`), `NativeTypeCheckerTests.fs`, `TypeCheckerRecoveryTests.fs` — is the seed of the **dimensional test set** the next increment measures; the content is in history at the deletion commit, and the new set is written against the current spec and namespaces, not ported.
- **Three FNCS-era plans** (`CCS_Phase1_Transformation_Plan`, `CCS_Pruning_Plan`, `RESTRUCTURING_PLAN`): FCS→FNCS→CCS transformation plans from December and January, executed or superseded by `phg/`.
- **Twenty upstream compiler docs** (IL backend, optimizer, FSI, MSBuild, perf, CI); `changing-the-ast.md` and `diagnostics.md` stay because CCS keeps that machinery.
- **Root artefacts**: dotnet/fsharp build and test scripts, VS setup, `.github` policies and workflows, upstream release notes and contributing guide, the `.DotSettings` and `.nuspec` under the old name, test-only MSBuild props, two scratch scripts. The build-imported props/targets, `buildtools/`, `global.json`, `NuGet.config` and `attributions.md` stay.
- **Generated lexer/parser outputs**: the obsolete `net9.0` copies removed; `net10.0` untracked and ignored (the fsproj regenerates them; the "fsnative" text they carried came from stale outputs, not from `lex.fsl`).
- **Code**: the dead `FSharp.Native.*` namespace whitelist in `NativeService.fs` (nothing opens it; the BCL block stands); "for F# Native" and "for Firefly" in doc comments.
- **Docs**: `docs/fidelity/README.md` rewritten from the current tree; `Firefly` → `Composer` across the spec and clef design docs; dead `/repos/Firefly/...` and agent-memory paths dropped from `CCS_Lazy_Seq_Coroutine_Intrinsics.md`.

Agent memories: the tracked `.serena/memories` in BAREWire (13 files, all carrying "FNCS reached production maturity", Firefly build claims, `nativeptr` intrinsics) and ClefAutoComplete (5) are removed. Composer's seventy memory files are untracked; sixteen carry retired claims (`fncs_functional_decomposition_principle`, `mlir_dialect_architecture`, `delimited_continuations_architecture`, `ccs_architecture`, `naming_and_ecosystem`, among them) and are listed for deletion or regeneration from the design of record; the gate reports them until they go.

Verification: Composer (which builds CCS as a project reference) builds clean after the sweep.

Reported, not failing: the tooling forks' module and project names (`FsNativeAutoComplete.*`, `HAVE_FNCS`), which are the first mechanical step of the Lattice migration; the ship-of-theseus talk, which narrates the rename; implementation PRDs; dated posts. Agent-memory directories (`.serena/memories`) are in the gate's corpus: they are a drift vector like any other document.

## Lattice and Atelier (2026-09-04)

The editor tooling and the IDE are bound by the same rule as Alex: they witness the PSG and compute nothing. The reconnaissance (six Lattice repos, four Atelier document clusters) is consolidated in [Lattice_Consumer_Contract.md](Lattice_Consumer_Contract.md): the query surface the server answers, the host surface Atelier reads, what the editor stops doing, the measured state of every fork, and the migration position.

- **The forks are Ionide/FsAutoComplete with a partial label.** ClefAutoComplete is FsAutoComplete v0.82.0 plus a ~3,200-line bridge to a compiler that no longer exists (it does not build); lattice-vscode is Ionide 7.30.0 bundling upstream `fsautocomplete` from NuGet with three disagreeing rename layers; lattice-vim could not start (rename half applied; fixed in this changeset); lattice-analyzers' twelve rules are void, residence suggestions, or graph queries. The gate now retires the naming family (FNCS, F# Native, fsnative, FSNAC, Firefly, Keystone) corpus-wide, counts the forks' upstream remainder rather than failing it, and reports each fork's references to the F# Compiler Service typed tree as the migration size (ClefAutoComplete 206, lattice-analyzers 29).
- **Position:** write the Lattice server fresh and thin against CCS; reduce the clients to registration plus Clef views; retire the analyzers repo; archive the previous-generation forks; delete the two non-repositories. Each fork's README now states this.
- **Atelier** (100% design) had 53 drift findings across the host architecture, the feature chapters, the knowledge layer and the WREN stack: a front end on Fable (a .NET dependency) beneath a self-hosting claim; a "native core" containing CCS as if it were Composer-compiled; a continuation runtime with lifecycle events, a `shift`/`effect` surface and multi-shot continuations against the settled one-shot frame; an FCS/typed-tree phase pipeline; invented coeffect names and an effect system the spec does not define; a second "interaction net representation" for flow-loss analysis computed in the IDE; a knowledge-layer decision score the compiler never produces and ledger "obligations" reusing the PSG's proof vocabulary; a coordinator with its own compiler instance beside the language server; PSG-shaped wire types declared in the client; layout written back into the graph; and `nativeint` handles where the boundary handle is `CHandle`. Mechanical fixes (names, dead paths, `!fir.string`) are applied; the sentence- and section-level corrections are being applied from the proposal round; the host-side facts Atelier wants are in the contract's §3 as CCS deliverables.

**Atelier corrections applied (2026-09-04).** All 53 findings, as exact edits and section rewrites across README, Commercial, docs 00–11 and the knowledge layer: the self-hosting claim is stated honestly (host is Clef through Composer; front end is F# through Fable, a .NET dependency, interim; JSIR named as the candidate, undecided); the native host holds transports (LSP client, artifact reader, runtime reader), not a "PSG engine"; CCS and CAC are named as .NET processes reached over LSP and artifact files; the continuation inspector reads the frame node (delimiter, cuts with discriminant values, live-across slots at literal offsets, segments) and the process's frame bytes, with no runtime and one-shot by default; the `shift`/`effect` example, the FCS phase pipeline, the invented coeffect names and the effect system are gone; flow-loss metrics and substrate costs are named as CCS-owned annotations Atelier reads; the knowledge layer's specific graph is the PSG read, the weave keys on CCS-exported class enumerations (the `DialectOp` anchor is gone), the decision score and ledger "obligations" are removed or renamed, and the agent surface separates compiler facts from derived data; one CCS instance serves the coordinator and the language server; PSG-shaped wire types move to a CCS/Lattice-owned protocol module; layout is viewer state, never written into the graph; the GPU tokenizer is dropped and Lezer is colouring-only; `nativeint` handles are `CHandle<'T>`; dead flags, methods and paths are marked proposed or removed. Placeholder LSP method names (`fidelity/*`) remain labelled as proposals until Lattice's design names the `clef/*` namespace.

**Atelier verification (2026-09-04, by hand).** The fleet verification and the dimensional recon both died on the account's spend limit; the verification was done by hand at the seams the four independent rewrites were most likely to disagree on. Continuation vocabulary is consistent (frame node, suspension frame, VC-ONE, one-shot by default) across 00, 03 and 04. The placeholder LSP extension methods were moved from `fidelity/*` to the contract's `clef/*` namespace (14 occurrences in 08, 09, 11), still labelled as proposals. The WebView abstraction chapter used the pre-rename WREN name (`wrendit` handler, `__wrendit_receive`, `wrendit://` scheme); it now uses `wren`, as the built WrenHello sample does, with the stack's default `wren://app/` scheme and Atelier's own `atelier://app/` registered by the application (04). Every intra-corpus link resolves; the one external link (the site's four-tiers page) exists. `languageId: 'fsharp'` in 02 is kept deliberately until the clients rename. The gate retires `wrendit`.

Decisions for you, carried in the contract: the JSIR reactive surface (whether the front end can ever be Clef); the Transcribe naming conflict with Composer; which knowledge-layer facts CCS should own (stable node identity, semantic delta, admissible-lowering annotation, flow-loss metrics, what-if saturation).

## Late additions (2026-09-04)

- **Inline-by-default retired as a stated principle.** Both NTU documents (`spec/native-type-universe.md` §6.3, and the parallel `clef/docs/fidelity/native-type-universe.md`, retired 2026-09-04) presented the absorbed library's inline-by-default model as Clef's; it was tried and reverted because it exploded the PSG. Rewritten to the explicit-`inline` policy of the attributes chapter (mandatory for SRTP generalization and for lifting a scope-bounded buffer, discouraged elsewhere, the optimizer deciding the rest). The gate retires the phrase.
- **Agent memories triaged and carried forward.** The 75 Serena memory files (Composer 70, clef 2, Atelier 3) were classified: retired design, derivable from the repos, or a carry-forward lesson. Twenty-one lessons that live nowhere else (working-method corrections, board and toolchain gotchas, the dropped Fidelity.Desktop layer, the MMIO volatile gap, the fundraising and demo plans, external repo and toolchain pointers, the explicit-inline history) are now in the Claude-native memory store with the session's own lessons; the `.serena/memories` trees can be deleted.
- **Two drift items the triage surfaced in the corpus, not fixed here:** `Composer/docs/WRENStack_Roadmap.md` §2 and `FidelityHelloWorld_Progression.md` still name `Fidelity.Desktop`, a layer dropped in March 2026 (windowing belongs to Fidelity.Platform, widgets to Fidelity.UI), and a `Fidelity.Desktop` directory still exists under `~/repos`; and memory-mapped register access on MCU targets lowers to plain `memref.load`/`store` with no volatile semantics (the `NTUMemorySpace.Peripheral` qualifier exists in CCS; nothing witnesses it), which is correct only at `-O0` and belongs to the access-pattern dimension of the NTU hardening.

## Dimensional typing (2026-09-04, next increment)

The measured state and the plan are in [Dimensional_Vetting_Plan.md](Dimensional_Vetting_Plan.md). The finding, from primary sources: units of measure are parsed and then discarded (`Literals.fs:42-46`, `Types.fs:948`), cannot be represented on the numeric kinds (arity 0), and never fail unification (`Unify.fs:251-286`, `HasMeasure` a no-op); arithmetic is typed `'T -> 'T -> 'T` with no numeric constraint and no dimension polymorphism; memory space and access kind ride the same unchecked path and no access-kind diagnostic exists, although the collections chapters cite `CCS8020`; the code's diagnostic series is `FS8xxx` against the spec's `CCS8xxx`; and two texts (`ntu-dimensional-architecture.md` §4.3/§5.2, `NativeTypes.fs:69-70`) place dimension resolution in Alex. The user ruled the dropping of units vestigial: units are integral to the NTU, and the correction is structural (representation and operator types), not a missing branch. Retired vocabulary added to the gate: "resolved by Alex", "erased metadata".

## Scheduled (code; reported, not failing)

| `Composer/docs/PRDs/` (`code_ptr`, `nativeptr` rows only; bannered) | move with the code | steps 1–5 |
| `clef/src/Compiler/` (`nativeptr` only; `TNativePtr` internal) | confirm `NativePtr.*` intrinsic recognition is gone | — |
| `clef/tests/` (`nativeptr` only; inherited F# test corpus) | retire with those tests | — |

| `clef/src/Compiler/Baker/Recipes/{List,Set,Map}Recipes.fs`, `Decomposition.fs` (`null`, `ptr<` only; header comments state the settled form) | the sentinel recipe: empty = index 0, links = bounded indices | Phase 3 collections |

## Also rewritten (design docs and site, on the `code_ptr` sweep)

`Closure_Nanopass_Architecture.md` §3 (pair form; interim indices noted), `Alex_Architecture_Overview.md` lazy sketch, `Partial_Application_Closure_Reification.md` (two lines), `PH2-04-Bootstrap-Options.md` ISR wording, clef `Layout_As_Joint_Constraint.md` prefix shapes (`CodePtr` case removed); site `why-lazy-is-hard.md`, `seqing-simplicity.md`, `gaining-closure.md` diagrams and tables.

## Open

- `closure-representation.md` §2.1's consequence — no `code_ptr` word in any environment — was drawn from C-01 §14.3 (a closure value is two SSA values, no packing) and closure-rep §7 (a seq/lazy value is a flat closure first). It changes the lazy and seq layouts and their normative field indices. If you want the environment to carry a code component for memory-resident closures, that is `Closure_Retooling_Plan`'s open decision and the chapters revert on that point only.
