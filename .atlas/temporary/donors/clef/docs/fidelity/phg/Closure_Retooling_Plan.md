## 0. The design that decides this

**2026-09-20 planning synchronization.** The current
[backend standard](../../../../clef-lang-spec/spec/backend-lowering-architecture.md#211-operation-and-pathway-admission)
and [Composer M-01](../../../../Composer/docs/PRDs/M-01-DialectAdmission.md)
govern operation/profile admission. Baker's Ingredients/Recipes and saturation
nanopasses construct the joint numeric, memory, continuation and wait
relationships. Alex observes those settled facts and the selected platform to
choose an admitted witness form. Numeric selection and arithmetic construction
govern arith/math realization; RPC and scheduler contracts govern blocking and
progress. Required source, platform and proof provenance must remain available
to backend consumers and the shared CCS editor projection. This is planned
integration work; the [waypoints](../../../../Composer/docs/Language_Coverage_Waypoints.md)
retain the actual acceptance boundaries and coordinated revisions.

| Decision | Cited by |
|---|---|
| Flat closure is the finiteness lemma; enumerated capture set = the hyperedge's source set | `Closure_Nanopass_Architecture` §4; spec `closure-representation` §11; DTS/DMM §3.2.1 |
| The environment node is the general object: closure env, DCont frame, actor cell share one fold-in rule | C-01 §14.1 |
| Seven forms, selected by a condition decidable at saturation; forms 1–2 materialize nothing | C-01 §14.2 |
| Every interior form is `func` + `memref` + `arith`; the closure value is **two SSA values, no packing, no casts** | C-01 §14.3 |
| VC-EXT / VC-DIS / VC-REG / VC-REL / VC-APP discharged at saturation, over the PSG, before witnessing | C-01 §14.4 |
| Layout is settled before emission; the witness reads it, never computes it | spec §9; `Closure_Nanopass_Architecture` §5 |
| Placement by the four-point lifetime lattice: stack / region / static / heap; no heap on a heapless target is a compile error | spec §3.3, §10.8 |
| Nested named functions pass captures as parameters — no struct | spec §8, §10.11–12 |
| Packing into words is a boundary event only, under the §6.7 contract | C-01 §14.2 "Fence packing is not a form"; §6.7 |
| The plugins are "interim… superseded when per-obligation correspondence lands" | `Thin_Middle_End` §3; `mlir-plugins/ROADMAP.md` |
| Hyperedges: `(S_f, t_f, λ_f)`, fire when all sources are elaborated; consequence reaches emission as α or as a reified attribute, never by querying F | PHG paper §2.1–2.4 |
| The witnessed vocabulary is fixed and additions go through the document first | `Thin_Middle_End` §22, §5 |

The earlier cast-deferral descriptions in the representation/backend chapters
have been superseded. The current standard requires the settled closure forms
and prohibits unrealized casts in middle-end output; it does not require a
per-target closure cast-resolution plugin. Historical `Gaining Closure` prose
and interim plugin notes do not override that contract. Remaining implementation
acceptance is recorded in the current C-series waypoints, independently of this
completed documentation correction.

## 1. What works and what does not — the FidelityHelloWorld set

**2026-09-19 bounded implementation update.** Baker now elaborates immutable
captures of eligible direct named functions into typed leading formals, using
ingredients, a recipe and nanopass fan-out/fold-in. Admission accounts for all
reachable uses; value uses, partial uses and mutable frontiers remain outside
this increment. Resolved definitions and nested capture sources follow identity,
with explicit capture-origin provenance and retained source signatures for editor
projection. The native `11a_DirectCaptures` oracle passes; it supplements the older
`11_Closures` case. The [companion waypoint record](../../../../Composer/docs/Language_Coverage_Waypoints.md)
pins compiler, native, proof and tooling evidence. This does not complete the
materialized forms, residence obligations or two-value closure migration below.

The following table remains the dated September 4 baseline.

Measured 2026-09-04 against the rebuilt compiler, each sample compiled
individually through the CLI and run against the manifest's expected output.
**17 of 24 pass end to end.**

| # | sample | PRD | compile | run | what fails |

| 13 | Recursion | C-03 | **FAIL** | — | `mlir-opt`: `region entry argument '%arg0' is already in use` — an SSA collision in `sumTo` |
| 14 | Lazy | C-05 | **FAIL** | — | `pBuildLazyForce: Expected at least 5 SSAs, got 3`; 45 `AX2001 arguments not yet witnessed` |
| 15 | SimpleSeq | C-06 | **FAIL** | — | `FS0001` on `while n <= max do` inside `seq { }` (three sites) |
| 16 | SeqOperations | C-07 | **FAIL** | — | `Unhandled intrinsic 'SeqEnumerator.moveNext'` |
| 17 | ExternCall | — | OK | OK | |

| 21 | RecordsAndTags | — | OK | OK | |
| 22 | UnionPayloads | — | OK | OK | |
| 23 | RecordSurface | — | OK | OK | |

**Five of the seven failures are the closure family.** Spec
`closure-representation` §7 defines the lazy value and the sequence expression
as *the flat closure extended with slot classes* — memoization slots
(`computed`, `value`) and state-machine slots (`state`, `current`, internal
state) — inheriting every property of the base representation. So 11, 12, 14,
15 and 16 fail for one reason with five faces: the closure representation is
settled below the graph, and what is settled there is wrong. Retooling the
closure is the gate for all five. 13 is an SSA-assignment collision in the same
"computed at emission" class at a different site; 06 is out of scope.

`13a_SimpleCollections` / `13a_BAREWireCollections` exist on disk (C-04) but are
not in the manifest and were not measured; the List surface is
`Surface_Gaps` §Deferred.

## 2. The microcosm, measured — sample 11 today

Compiled fresh with the rebuilt compiler, `07_output.mlir`:

| | count |
|---|---|
| `builtin.unrealized_conversion_cast` | **28** |
| `memref<2xindex>` (the packed pair) | 72 |
| `func.call_indirect` | 15 |

Every one of the 28 casts is a fact settled below the graph — "what a function
value is as data, what a buffer is as data" — that the `flat-closure-lowering`
plugin resolves after standard lowering. Remove the plugin today and the build
fails at `--reconcile-unrealized-casts`. And the values it produces are wrong.

The path that produces this, per the witness-boundary audit: `ClosureLayout`
built in Composer's `SSAAssignment.fs:202-320` with ~7 vestigial fields
repurposed as scratch; byte offsets computed in `LambdaWitness.fs` with two
`// Approximate` comments, and computed **a second time, independently** in
`ClosurePatterns.fs` on the extraction side; SSAs minted at emission
(`V (10000 + tempIdx)`); `pFlatClosure` dead on the live path.

## 3. The target form

C-01 §14.3, primitive by primitive:

```mlir
// construction, in the parent — a form-3 (stack flat) closure over one i32
%env = memref.alloca() : memref<4xi8>                    ; extent literal (VC-EXT)
%c0  = arith.constant 0 : index                          ; offset literal (VC-DIS)
%f0  = memref.view %env[%c0][] : memref<4xi8> to memref<1xi32>
memref.store %n, %f0[%c0] : memref<1xi32>
%fn  = func.constant @makeAdder_lambda : (memref<4xi8>, i32) -> i32
; the closure value is (%fn, %env): two SSA values. Nothing is packed.

// invocation
%r = func.call_indirect %fn(%env, %x) : (memref<4xi8>, i32) -> i32

// the body — receives the environment; captures are views at literal offsets
func.func private @makeAdder_lambda(%env: memref<4xi8>, %x: i32) -> i32 {
  %c0 = arith.constant 0 : index
  %v  = memref.view %env[%c0][] : memref<4xi8> to memref<1xi32>
  %n  = memref.load %v[%c0] : memref<1xi32>
  ...
```

No cast anywhere. `--convert-func-to-llvm` lowers `func.constant` and
`call_indirect`; `--finalize-memref-to-llvm` lowers the views. Stock passes.

**The one open design decision, named.** Two SSA values cover binding, passing,
returning, and HOF arguments — every case in sample 11. They do not by
themselves cover a closure **stored as data**: captured by another closure, or
carried as a DU payload (spec §8.1 calls that an escape point). A `memref`
cannot hold a function-typed element, and function→data with no cast has no
standard form. §14.2 is where this resolves: form 2 *Unmaterialized* when the
callee is statically known at every site (a lambda literal captured by a
lambda — the outer environment stores the inner *environment*, and the inner
code is re-materialized by symbol); a materialized function field only when the
callee is genuinely unknown (a closure *parameter* captured by a lambda). The
second case is the `makeScaledAdder` / PAP territory `Partial_Application_
Closure_Reification` records as an open gap. **Step 6 below writes that
decision down before any code touches it.** Nothing in steps 1–5 depends on it.

## 4. The mechanism — and only this mechanism

The closure becomes a Baker recipe; the pass is fan-out → fold-in; the witness
reads. This is C-01 §14.7's "recipe migration", and it reuses what Increment 1
built.

**Ingredients** (`Baker/Ingredients/Closures.fs`, new):
the environment node; capture nodes carrying mode (`ByValue`/`ByRef` from
`CaptureInfo.IsMutable`); the code reference; the escape-class edge; the
release-site edge. These are C-01 §14.1's five structures as node/edge
constructors. Plus the closure hyperedge:

```
f_closure = (S_f = captured bindings ∪ {lambda},  t_f = environment node,  λ_f = ClosureForm)
```

**Recipes** (`Baker/Recipes/ClosureRecipes.fs`, new):
- *fan-out* — for each capturing `Lambda`: mint the five structures and the
  hyperedge. A nested named binding is only a candidate for the direct form:
  all uses must establish direct, nonescaping invocation (spec §8). In that form,
  captures become leading parameters without an environment allocation. The
  current implementation admits immutable captures; mutable storage needs its
  own truthful parameter, range-effect and residence contract before admission.
- *fold-in* — select the form (§14.2) from modes, escape class, and sizes;
  compute the layout with `placeSlots` (`Layout_As_Joint_Constraint` §2.3 —
  the one placement function, taking `PlatformContext`); emit VC-EXT/DIS/REG/
  REL/APP as obligation hyperedges through `Baker/Ingredients/Obligations`;
  project the layout onto α (`LayoutHint` on the environment node,
  `SlotPlacement` on each capture).

**Pass** (`Nanopass/ClosureElaboration.fs`, new): discovers capturing lambdas,
applies the recipes, folds. Same shape as `ObligationElaboration`.

**Witness** (`LambdaWitness.fs`, rewritten to the ~20-line thin observer the
Alex architecture mandates): reads the form and the placements; emits the §14.3
table row for row. `ClosurePatterns.fs` becomes the ~50-line composition of
`memref.alloca` / `memref.view` / `memref.store` / `func.constant` /
`func.call_indirect` over settled literals. Zero `sizeOf`. Zero offset
arithmetic. Zero minted SSAs.

**Escape classification** moves to CCS with this step, because fold-in reads it.
`EscapeAnalysis.fs`'s classification is the spec §3.3 lattice; it becomes a
saturated annotation the recipe consumes, not a Composer coeffect the witness
defaults when absent.

## 5. What is removed

| Removed | Why | Cited |
|---|---|---|
| `flat-closure-lowering` from `BackEnd/LLVM/Lowering.fs` pipeline (`resolve-closure-casts`) | nothing left to resolve | §14.3 |
| `MemRefOp.IndexToMemRef`/`MemRefToIndex`, `FuncOp.IndexToFunc`/`FuncToIndex` and their `unrealized_conversion_cast` serialization | the cast constructors | `Thin_Middle_End` §3 |
| `ClosureLayout` (`Coeffects.fs:72-133`) and `buildClosureLayout` (`SSAAssignment.fs:202-320`) | layout is the hyperedge's λ_f, settled in CCS | spec §9 |
| offset computation in `LambdaWitness.fs:317-327, 546-632` and `ClosurePatterns.fs:226-268` | the witness reads | `Closure_Nanopass` §5 |
| `V (10000 + tempIdx)` minting (`LambdaWitness:617`, `ClosurePatterns:103`) | SSAs are pre-assigned | Learning to Walk |
| `pFlatClosure`, `pNamedFunctionAsClosure` thunk synthesis | dead / synthesized below the graph | audit §4g |
| the packed `memref<2xindex>` pair everywhere it is constructed or read | replaced by multi-value | §14.3 |

`reconcile-ffi-externs` stays for now: it is the `ffi.` fence, and the fence
becomes a boundary hyperedge under §6.7 — a later increment.

## 6. Steps, gated

Each step lands only when its gate is green. RoundTrip and the HelloProof
harness run at every step and must not move.

1. **Measure** (§1 table). Gate: per-sample compile/run verdicts recorded;
   this is the baseline every later step is diffed against.
2. **`placeSlots` in CCS** (from `Layout_As_Joint_Constraint` §2.3). Gate:
   reproduces today's x86_64 offsets for every record and closure in samples
   10, 11, 21, 23; the DU `tryHead` divergence is the one expected difference.
3. **Closure ingredients + recipes + pass**, fan-out only — the five structures
   and the hyperedge in the graph, nothing consumed yet. Gate: `05_psg2.json`
   shows the environment nodes and closure hyperedges for sample 11 (four
   arity ≥ 2 edges: `makeGreeter`, `makeAdder`, `makeRangeChecker`,
   `makeFormatter`); every existing gate unchanged.
4. **Fold-in**: form selection, layout onto α, VCs as obligations. Gate:
   `06a` gains the closure families (callsheet 8, 9, 11); `cvc5` unsat on all;
   HelloProof unchanged (it has no capturing lambda that materializes).
5. **The witness reads; the casts go; the plugin goes.** `LambdaWitness` /
   `ClosurePatterns` rewritten; cast constructors deleted; `Lowering.fs`
   pipeline loses `resolve-closure-casts`. Gate: sample 11 **prints its
   expected output** (C-01 §8.2, the first time); `grep -c
   unrealized_conversion_cast 07_output.mlir` = **0** on every sample that
   compiles; `Lowering.fs` has no `--load-pass-plugin` for closures.
6. **The stored-closure decision.** A design note (`Closure_As_Data.md`)
   deciding §14.2 form selection for a closure captured by a closure and for
   DU payloads, citing spec §8.1 and `Partial_Application_Closure_Reification`
   Option A. Then `makeScaledAdder` returns to sample 11 and prints. Gate:
   sample 11's TODO is gone and it passes; sample 12 passes.
7. **Spec leads — done 2026-09-04.** The spec moved ahead of the code rather
   than following it: `closure-representation` §2.1/§6.3, `backend-lowering`
   §2.2/§4/§7, `lazy-representation`, `seq-representation`,
   `seq-operations-representation`, `ntu-types` §8.1, and `ffi-boundary` §3.2
   now bind the multi-value form and SHALL NOT the cast. Steps 4–5 therefore
   have a normative target to conform to, and the code is the gap until they
   land. The consequence drawn there — no `code_ptr` word in any environment,
   captures from `[0]` (closure) and `[2]` (lazy, seq) — is recorded in the
   register's *Open* item for veto.

8. **Supersede the stale design claims — done 2026-09-04.** The full
   classified inventory is `Design_Supersession_Register.md`, executed across
   clef, Composer, clef-lang-spec, clef-lang-site, and ship-of-theseus, and
   enforced by `drift-gate.sh` (below). c1/c3/c4 (the continuation chapters)
   were rewritten to the suspension recipe ahead of the recipe's code, on the
   same footing as step 7: the design decides, the code conforms.

## 7. The drift gates — checked in CI, not remembered

These are the structural guarantees. Each is a grep or an assertion; each is
seeded green (or seeded with today's known violations as a warning list that
must only shrink) and becomes an error when its list empties.

| Gate | Rule | Enforces |
|---|---|---|
| **Dialect register** | every op prefix in `07_output.mlir` ∈ {`func`, `memref`, `arith`, `scf`, `index`} ∪ the admitted list in `Thin_Middle_End` §5; anything else fails | `Thin_Middle_End` §22, §5. **Admitting `affine` (or any dialect) = a row in the register, a design citation, and the sample that needs it.** Step-wise by construction. |
| **Retired vocabulary** | `docs/fidelity/phg/drift-gate.sh` exits 0: no `cont.*`/`dcont.*` surface, no DCont/Inet dialect, no `unrealized_conversion_cast`, no `memref<2xindex>`, no `code_ptr`, no `flattenSequentials`, no `resolve-closure-casts`, no seven-dialect list, anywhere in the corpus except the superseding designs and the *scheduled* code rows (which only shrink) | `Design_Supersession_Register` |
| **No deferred casts** | `unrealized_conversion_cast` count in witnessed MLIR = 0 | §14.3 | — today a *scheduled* row in `drift-gate.sh` (`Alex/`, `PSGElaboration/`, `tests/`, `samples/`); removing the row turns this gate on
| **No plugins** | `Lowering.fs` contains no `--load-pass-plugin` for closure resolution | `Thin_Middle_End` §3 | — today a *scheduled* row (`BackEnd/LLVM/Lowering.fs`, `mlir-plugins/`)
| **Witnesses read** | no `sizeOf`, `mlirTypeSize*`, mutable byte-offset accumulator, or `V (10000 +` in `Alex/Witnesses/` or `Alex/Patterns/` | spec §9; audit §4d/4f |
| **No F in the witness** | no reference to `graph.Edges` / `SemanticGraph.edges*` under `Alex/` | PHG §2.4 (I4) |
| **I1 — enumerated sources** | in-tree assertion at fold-in: every hyperedge has ≥1 source, every source ∈ V, every closure hyperedge's sources = exactly the lambda's `CaptureInfo` list | finiteness lemma |
| **No name dispatch** | no `Kind.ToString().StartsWith` in `Alex/` | `CCS_Architecture` §225 |
| **Layer firewall** | `Elements/` stay `module internal`; no `open Alex.Witnesses` inside `Witnesses/` | `Alex_Architecture_Overview` §Enforcement |

The dialect register is the one you asked for: the original five were a
forcing function against sprawl, and the register keeps the forcing function
while making admission a formal, visible act rather than a silent `open`.

The register has two halves, and the FPGA and GPU legs are the precedent for
the second. *Above* the boundary, the witnessed vocabulary — where `affine`,
`async`, and the parallelism/threading dialects will be admitted as the PSG
comes to express them. *Below* the boundary, per `Thin_Middle_End` §4, a
dialect is justified exactly when it "expresses the target upward": CIRCT on
the FPGA leg, MLIR-AIE on the NPU leg. The audit's finding that `hw`/`comb`/
`seq` are emitted *at* the witness rather than below it is the marshaling still
owed at that demarcation; the register records which half each dialect lives
in, so the demarcation is checkable too.

## 8. What this does not do

- The FFI fence (`reconcile-ffi-externs`, the `ffi.` namespace, callback tiers
  A/B/C). That is the §6.7 boundary hyperedge — its own increment, after this
  one, because it packs closures into words *at the fence* and needs the
  interior form settled first. Its two acceptance programs already exist:
  **HelloWayland** (the listener shape — registration, invocations, and release
  as one lifetime claim; Tier B) and **WrenHello** (the WREN stack's WebView in
  a native application — the host-operation surface, the script-message
  channel, the length-carried-string rule as a Platform obligation). GTK is set
  aside as a direct dependency; D-01 follows WrenHello's shape, not the reverse.
- Lazy / seq / DCont frames. They are instances of the same environment node
  (§14.1) and extend the flat closure with slot classes (spec §7). This plan
  lands the base representation; they follow as recipes over it.
- Affine, threading, process management. The register is where they enter.
