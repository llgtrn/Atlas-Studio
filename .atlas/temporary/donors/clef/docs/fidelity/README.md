# Clef Compiler Service (CCS)

CCS is the front end of the Fidelity toolchain: it lexes, parses and type-checks Clef source in the
Native Type Universe (NTU) and produces the **Program Semantic Graph (PSG)**, a hypergraph that is the
sole, exhaustive semantic authority for everything downstream. Composer's middle end (Alex) witnesses
the saturated graph into MLIR; the editor tooling (Lattice) witnesses it into hover, diagnostics and
proof surfacing. Neither computes anything the graph does not already carry.

CCS descends from a surgical fork of dotnet/fsharp's front end (lexer, parser, syntax tree, diagnostics
infrastructure). The typed tree, IL generation, optimizer, FSI, MSBuild tasks and the inherited test
corpus have been removed; what remains is the Clef checker and the graph it saturates.

## Where the design lives

The canonical implementation roadmap is Composer's
[Clef language completion analysis](../../../Composer/docs/Clef_Language_Completion_Analysis.md),
with its [workload frame](../../../Composer/docs/Clef_Language_Completion_Workload_Frame.md)
and [September review](../../../Composer/docs/Clef_Language_Completion_Review_2026-09-19.md).
The documents here supply CCS design details and historical context; older
strategy and orientation prose does not supply a competing work sequence.

| Document | What it is |
|---|---|
| [phg/](phg/) | The design of record: the PSG-to-PHG plan, layout as joint constraint, the closure retooling plan, the **Design Supersession Register**, and [`drift-gate.sh`](phg/drift-gate.sh), which makes retired vocabulary a lint failure across the corpus |
| The language specification | lives in `clef-lang-spec/spec/` and nowhere else: `native-type-universe.md`, `ntu-types.md`, `ntu-dimensional-architecture.md`, `units-of-measure.md`, `width-inference.md`, `numeric-selection.md`, `access-kinds.md`, `memory-regions.md`, `platform-bindings.md`, `error-handling.md`. The parallel copies this folder carried (`ccs-specification.md`, `native-type-universe.md`, `NTU_Type_System.md`) were retired on 2026-09-04 as drift sources |
| [Baker_Saturation_Architecture.md](Baker_Saturation_Architecture.md) | Baker: ingredients and recipes that saturate the graph (collections, obligations, closures, suspension) |
| [Closed_Native_Callback_Adapters.md](Closed_Native_Callback_Adapters.md) | Declared binding-owned adapters specialized for known closed module handlers; captured-environment callbacks remain future work |
| [CCS_Lazy_Seq_Coroutine_Intrinsics.md](CCS_Lazy_Seq_Coroutine_Intrinsics.md) | Historical operation inventory; its Alex-owned frame/coroutine strategies are superseded by Baker suspension and Composer's current roadmap |
| [Platform_Predicates.md](Platform_Predicates.md) | Platform description as declared authority; predicates read structurally from the graph |
| [Obligation Residency](../../../Composer/docs/Obligation_Residency_Design.md), [Proof Composition](../../../Composer/docs/Proof_Composition_Architecture.md) | Graph-born obligations, artifact correspondence, checking scope and proof composition; specific implementation status is recorded in the PHG and Lattice work |
| [Dimensional Handoff](phg/Dimensional_Handoff.md), [Lattice Consumer Contract](phg/Lattice_Consumer_Contract.md) | Current dimensional authority order and the editor's versioned view of graph facts and checking results |
| [From_FSharp_to_Clef.md](From_FSharp_to_Clef.md), [Clef_Language_Vision.md](Clef_Language_Vision.md) | Historical orientation, not an implementation roadmap or evidence of current language support; further drift is identified in the September review |
| [Safety_Critical_Certification.md](Safety_Critical_Certification.md), [Certification_Lab_Strategy.md](Certification_Lab_Strategy.md) | The certification posture the proof story serves |

The normative language specification is [clef-lang-spec](https://github.com/FidelityFramework/clef-lang-spec);
the Composer-side architecture (Alex, the witness boundary, the thin middle end) is in `Composer/docs/`.

CCS builds inside Composer's solution as a project reference; it is not a standalone .NET library.

## The one rule

The design decides; the code conforms. Where code and design disagree, the code is the gap, and the
[register](phg/Design_Supersession_Register.md) records what was retired and why. Run the drift gate
before proposing a change to any document in this tree:

```
docs/fidelity/phg/drift-gate.sh
```
