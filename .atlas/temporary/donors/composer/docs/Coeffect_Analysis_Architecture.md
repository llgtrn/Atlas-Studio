# Coeffect Analysis Architecture

> **Coeffect Analysis** is the computation of metadata about the PSG that enables lowering strategy decisions. It is fundamentally distinct from **Enrichment** (node synthesis) - coeffects analyze structure, they don't create it.

## Overview

In functional programming theory, **effects** describe what a computation does to its environment (mutation, I/O, exceptions), while **coeffects** describe what a computation requires from its environment (context, resources, capabilities).

In the Fidelity compiler, **Coeffect Analysis** extends this concept to encompass all metadata computation that informs lowering strategies. This includes:
- SSA assignment (variable lifetimes and versions)
- Mutability analysis (which bindings are mutable, which are addressed)
- Yield state tracking (for sequence expressions) — interim; superseded by the suspension recipe, which settles segments and frame slots on the graph at saturation ([Delimited_Continuations_Architecture.md](./Delimited_Continuations_Architecture.md))
- Pattern binding analysis (for match expressions)
- String table construction (for string literals)

## The Critical Distinction

### Enrichment: Synthesizing Structure

Enrichment (elaboration + saturation) creates PSG nodes:
- Input: PSG with some nodes
- Output: PSG with more nodes
- The structure of the graph changes

### Coeffect Analysis: Computing Metadata

Coeffect analysis computes information about existing structure:
- Input: Saturated PSG
- Output: Metadata/indices/maps about the PSG
- The structure of the graph is unchanged

### Hyperedge Enrichment: Structure Over F

Since the hypergraph landed in CCS (2026-09) there is a third class, and it is enrichment, not analysis. A recipe over the hyperedge set $F$ creates **nodes and edges**: an obligation node whose `Constrains` edge names the storages it governs, a `Resides` edge from a buffer to the platform space that declares it, a layout edge whose source set is every literal it places. Its consequence reaches the witness only as annotations projected onto the governed nodes (the transport rule, spec `program-hypergraph.md` §5) — the witness never queries $F$. What used to be authored as a coeffect in this repository (the readln buffer capacity, the consecutive placement of string literals, the closure layout) is, class by class, becoming a consequence of $F$ settled in CCS; the coeffect table above shrinks as that happens, and nothing in it is authoritative where the graph already carries the fact.

## Why Coeffects Matter for Fidelity

### The Control-Flow ↔ Dataflow Duality

This is the essence of the "Fidelity" in Fidelity framework.

Clef source code expresses computations declaratively (dataflow style):
```fsharp
let result = items |> List.map transform |> List.filter predicate
```

But native code execution is inherently control-flow oriented:
```
loop:
  load item
  call transform
  test predicate
  branch ...
```

Coeffect analysis provides the information needed to **pivot between these representations** while preserving semantic fidelity.

### The Pivot Decision

Given a computation, the compiler can lower it via:
1. **Control-flow emphasis** - Explicit loops, branches, state machines
2. **Dataflow emphasis** - SIMD operations, vectorization, fusion

The choice depends on:
- Target platform capabilities (SIMD width, cache structure)
- Input characteristics (known size, streaming vs materialized)
- Operation semantics (can it vectorize? does order matter?)

**Coeffect analysis provides the data needed to make this decision correctly.**

## Coeffect Analysis Components

### 1. SSA Assignment

Computes Single Static Assignment form for the PSG:
- Each variable binding gets a unique SSA name
- Tracks variable versions through mutations
- Enables register allocation and optimization

```fsharp
type SSAAssignment = {
    NodeToSSA: Map<NodeId, SSA>
    BindingVersions: Map<string, int>
}
```

**Why it's a coeffect:** SSA names are metadata about bindings, not new nodes. The PSG structure is unchanged; we're computing a mapping.

### 2. Mutability Analysis

Identifies mutable state patterns:
- Which bindings are mutable (`let mutable`)
- Which mutable bindings have their address taken (`&x`)
- Which variables are modified in loop bodies
- Module-level mutable bindings (require special initialization)

```fsharp
type MutabilityAnalysis = {
    AddressedMutableBindings: Set<NodeId>
    ModifiedVarsInLoopBodies: Set<NodeId>
    ModuleLevelMutableBindings: (string * NodeId * NodeId) list
}
```

**Why it's a coeffect:** This is analysis of existing structure. We're classifying bindings, not creating new ones.

### 3. Yield State Indices

For sequence expressions, tracks:
- Number of yield points
- State machine structure (Sequential vs WhileBased)
- Internal state variable mappings

```fsharp
type YieldStateAnalysis = {
    SeqExprId: NodeId
    NumYields: int
    BodyKind: SeqBodyKind
    Yields: (NodeId * int * NodeId) list  // YieldId, StateIndex, ValueId
    InternalState: (string * NodeId * int) list  // Name, BindingId, StructIndex
}
```

**Why it's a coeffect:** Yield indices are metadata for state machine generation. The seq expression nodes already exist; we're computing their state machine layout.

### 4. Pattern Binding Analysis

For match expressions, tracks:
- Entry pattern bindings (top-level matches)
- Case-specific bindings (per-branch bindings)
- Binding lifetimes and scopes

```fsharp
type PatternBindingAnalysis = {
    EntryPatternBindings: (NodeId * string * NativeType) list
    CasePatternBindings: Map<int, (NodeId * string * NativeType) list>
}
```

**Why it's a coeffect:** Pattern bindings are structural analysis. The match expression exists; we're computing how values flow through it.

### 5. String Table

Collects string literals for data section emission:
- Global name assignment
- Content and byte length
- Deduplication

```fsharp
type StringEntry = {
    GlobalName: string
    Content: string
    ByteLength: int
}
```

**Why it's a coeffect:** String literals exist in the PSG. The table is metadata enabling efficient data section layout.

## Pipeline Placement

```
Source Code → CCS → PSG Construction
                          ↓
                    CCS Resolution

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│          PSG SATURATION             │  ← Enrichment happens here

```

### Why Analysis Happens After Saturation

1. **Complete structure required** - SSA assignment needs to see ALL bindings, including those synthesized by Baker.

2. **Yield states need full seq body** - Seq expression analysis requires the complete state machine structure, which Baker provides.

3. **Mutability must see enriched code** - Baker may introduce mutable accumulators; mutability analysis must see them.

## The "Only Pay for What You Use" Principle

Coeffect analyses are demand-driven:

| If the PSG contains... | Then run... |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Seq expressions | YieldStateAnalysis |
| Mutable bindings | MutabilityAnalysis |
| Match expressions | PatternBindingAnalysis |
| String literals | StringTableCollection |
| Any bindings | SSAAssignment (always) |

This is efficient: a simple program with no sequences doesn't pay for sequence analysis.

## Serialization: `alex_coeffects.json`

All coeffect analysis results are serialized for debugging:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "ssaAssignment": {
    "nodeToSSA": { "42": "v0", "43": "v1" },
    "bindingVersions": { "x": 2, "y": 1 }
  },
  "mutability": {
    "addressedMutableBindings": [55, 67],
    "moduleLevelMutableBindings": [
      { "name": "counter", "bindingId": 55, "initialValueId": 56 }
    ]
  },
  "yieldStates": {
    "seqYields": [
      {
        "seqExprId": 100,
        "numYields": 3,
        "bodyKind": "WhileBased",
        "yields": [...]
      }
    ]
  },
  "strings": [
    { "globalName": "@str_abc123", "content": "Hello", "byteLength": 5 }
  ]
}
```

This enables:
- Debugging lowering decisions
- Understanding state machine layout
- Verifying SSA correctness
- Auditing mutability handling

## The Control-Flow ↔ Dataflow Pivot in Practice

### Example: Sequence Expression

Source (dataflow style):
```fsharp
seq {
    for x in items do
        if predicate x then
            yield transform x
}
```

Coeffect analysis provides:
- Yield count: 1
- Body kind: WhileBased
- State variables: iterator position, current value

With this metadata, Alex can choose:
- **Control-flow lowering:** State machine with explicit transitions
- **Dataflow lowering:** (if items is known-size array) Vectorized filter-map

### Example: List Operations

Source (dataflow style):
```fsharp
items |> List.map f |> List.filter p |> List.fold g init
```

Coeffect analysis provides:
- Operation chain structure
- Intermediate type sizes
- Potential fusion opportunities

With this metadata, Alex can choose:
- **Control-flow lowering:** Three separate traversals
- **Dataflow lowering:** Fused single-pass with deforestation

## Why This is "Fidelity"

The Fidelity framework preserves semantic correctness while enabling optimal lowering:

1. **Clef semantics preserved** - The user's code means exactly what Clef says it means
2. **Native efficiency achieved** - Lowering exploits platform capabilities
3. **Pivot informed by coeffects** - Analysis provides data for correct decisions

Without coeffect analysis, the compiler would either:
- Always use conservative lowering (inefficient)
- Make uninformed optimization decisions (potentially incorrect)

Coeffects enable **informed, correct optimization**.

## Design Principles

### 1. Analysis Not Transformation

Coeffect analysis never modifies the PSG. It only computes metadata. This ensures:
- PSG remains the single source of truth
- Analysis results can be recomputed
- Debugging shows original structure

### 2. Demand-Driven Computation

Analyses run only when needed. A module with no sequences has no sequence analysis overhead.

### 3. Serializable Results

All coeffect data serializes to JSON for debugging and tooling integration.

### 4. Pipeline Phase Discipline

Coeffect analysis runs AFTER enrichment, BEFORE lowering. This ordering is architecturally required.

## Second-Horizon Reach

Coeffect and codata analysis is also the carriage for the framework's furthest stated reach, second horizon or beyond. In the working paper "Fixed-Point Scaffolding", three axes meet at a PSG node: compilation, joint-constraint, and verification-strength. "Negative and Fractional Types" proposes the duality dimension as a fourth, parallel to those three, with η morphisms creating dual pairs and ε morphisms annihilating them. Its audit-log hyperedges would pair positive and negative cells, with Baker's elaboration carrying the type-level pairing as PSG codata for these analyses to read, and the paper states that reversal verification remains decidable because the dependencies are structurally explicit in the flat closure representation. That is the load path: flat closures (the finiteness lemma, with the form family of [C-01 PRD](./PRDs/C-01-Closures.md) Section 14), thunks (the lazy slot class), and incremental (cutoff by environment closedness) are the members beneath the reach, and its guarantees hold exactly as far as those three hold. [Delimited_Continuations_Architecture.md](./Delimited_Continuations_Architecture.md) carries the continuation frame as an instance of that same Section 14 environment, [Thin_Middle_End_Design.md](./Thin_Middle_End_Design.md) holds the witness boundary that governs this work, and the spec today carries negative and fractional types only as proposed, non-normative entries in `clef-lang-spec/spec/terms-and-definitions.md`, with [Negative_Fractional_Types_Architecture.md](./Negative_Fractional_Types_Architecture.md) as the companion treatment those entries name.

With the third admitted paper, "Adaptive Domain Models", the scaffold has geometric-algebra underpinnings that support the engineering and are evinced by the theory of its decidability. Blade-support masks are coeffects in this document's sense: the PHG paper states the output support of a geometric-product hyperedge as the set of symmetric differences over the operand masks, a sound over-approximation, with the guarantee that no arithmetic path exists for a foreclosed component. Joint resolution discharges through the standing tiers, with the furthest formal reach as the stated exception: cryptographic relational proofs in pRHL sit at the relational tier (Tier 4), where interactive formalization enters.
