# QuantumCredential Documentation

## Vision

QuantumCredential is a hardware/software co-designed quantum random number generator (QRNG) that produces cryptographically certified entropy for post-quantum security applications. Unlike software-only approaches that treat hardware as a black box, QuantumCredential uses **mathematics to guide both hardware architecture and software implementation**, achieving results that managed runtimes cannot match.

This documentation covers the complete system: from quantum physics (avalanche noise in Zener diodes) through analog circuit design, digital sampling, mathematical combination, native compilation, and cryptographic validation.

## The Abstraction Ceiling Problem

Software engineers are trained to work *above* hardware abstractions. We call `RandomNumberGenerator.GetBytes()` and trust that something reasonable happens. This works for most applications, but creates a fundamental problem for security-critical systems:

> **The abstraction ceiling becomes an abstraction floor for adversaries.**

When you cannot see below your abstraction layer, you cannot verify what happens there. An attacker who understands the hardware, the entropy sources, and the timing characteristics has an advantage you cannot counter from above.

QuantumCredential inverts this relationship. By co-designing hardware and software with shared mathematical foundations, we create systems where:

- Security guarantees are **provable**, not assumed
- Entropy quality is **measured**, not trusted
- Attack resistance is **architectural**, not hoped-for

This documentation is written for software engineers who want to understand what exists below their usual abstraction layer, and why it matters.

## Key Insight: Why Four Channels?

The four-channel architecture isn't arbitrary. It emerges from mathematics:

1. **XOR Theorem**: If either input to XOR is random, the output is random
2. **Bias Reduction**: Two channels reduce bias from ε to 2ε²
3. **Tree Structure**: Four channels in a tree reduce bias to 8ε⁴
4. **Practical Impact**: 5% per-channel bias → 0.005% output bias (1000× improvement)

The hardware (four independent avalanche diodes) implements a mathematical requirement. The software (parallel XOR tree) expresses the same mathematics. They are designed together because they implement the same theorem.

## Reading Order for Software Engineers

If you are coming from a pure software background:

1. **Start with M-01** (XOR Entropy Theorem) - understand *why* this works
2. **Read M-02** (Bias Reduction) - see the mathematics that guides hardware
3. **Skim H-02** (Avalanche Circuit) - see how physics becomes electronics
4. **Study E-02** (Epsilon Evaluation) - the core demo capability
5. **Read C-02** (Zero-Copy Pipeline) - why managed runtimes cannot do this
6. **Review V-03** (EM Attack Resistance) - defense through architecture

This path takes you from mathematical foundations through hardware implementation to security guarantees: the journey from abstraction ceiling to abstraction floor.
