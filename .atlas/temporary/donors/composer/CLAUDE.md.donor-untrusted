# Composer Compiler - Claude Context

## Language Coverage Checkpoints

When continuing language/compiler work, read the latest entries in
`docs/Language_Coverage_Waypoints.md` and their referenced contracts alongside
the roadmap. Keep that record current at each completed checkpoint: concrete
scope, validation results, companion repository revisions, and the next unsettled
contract. Distinguish pending implementation from tested behavior so later
sessions can resume from the recorded state.

## Alex Architecture

The Element/Pattern/Witness model with XParsec throughout:

```
Elements/    (module internal)  →  Atomic MLIR ops with XParsec state threading
Patterns/    (public)           →  Composable elision templates (~50 lines each)
Witnesses/   (public)           →  Thin observers (~20 lines each)
```

Elements are `module internal` — witnesses physically cannot import them.

### Golden Rules
1. Codata principle — witnesses observe and return, never build or compute
2. Gap emergence — if transform logic needed, return `TRError` and fix in CCS
3. **NEVER create git commits** — that is the user's responsibility

---

## Decision-Making Discipline

When implementation has multiple apparent options, **do not present them as equal choices** when architectural principles clearly dictate one answer. Apply the Fidelity design filters before presenting options:

1. **Clef-native vs legacy** — Always use Clef-native constructs (FnPtr<'F> not delegate, NativeDefault.zeroed not Unchecked.defaultof, NTU dimensional types not fixed-width). We are not in the F#/.NET business.
2. **Type-preserving vs type-erasing** — Always preserve type information at boundaries (FnPtr<'F> not nativeint for callbacks).
3. **NTU-aligned vs premature concretization** — Never bake CPU-specific widths into generated code. The DTS defers resolution to platform context.
4. **CCS-compatible vs aspirational** — Generate code that targets CCS's *current* type algebra, not capabilities that don't exist yet.

Only present genuine choices when principles don't clearly favor one direction. ~90% of the time there is no real choice given the compiler's architectural imperatives.

## Architectural Principles

### The Cardinal Rule: Fix Upstream

**Never patch where symptoms appear.** This is a multi-stage compiler pipeline. Trace upstream to find the root cause:

```
Native Binary ← LLVM ← MLIR ← Alex/Zipper ← Nanopasses ← PSG ← FCS ← CCS ← Clef Source
```

Fix at the EARLIEST pipeline stage where the defect exists. Before any fix, answer:
1. Have I traced through the full pipeline?
2. Am I fixing the ROOT CAUSE or patching a SYMPTOM?
3. Am I adding library-specific logic to a layer that shouldn't know about libraries?
4. Does my fix require code generation to "know" about specific function names?

If #3 or #4 is "yes", STOP. You're about to violate layer separation.

### Layer Separation

| Layer | Does | Does NOT |
|-------|------|----------|
| **CCS** | Define native types (NTUKind) and intrinsic ops | Generate code or know targets |
| **FCS** | Parse, type-check, resolve symbols | Transform or generate code |
| **PSG Builder** | Construct semantic graph from FCS | Make targeting decisions |
| **Nanopasses** | Enrich PSG with edges/classifications | Generate MLIR or know targets |
| **Alex/Zipper** | Traverse PSG, emit MLIR via bindings | Pattern-match on symbol names |
| **Bindings** | Platform-specific MLIR generation | Know about Clef syntax |

### Compose from Standing Art

New features MUST compose from recently established patterns, not invent parallel mechanisms. Before implementing anything: What patterns from the last 2-3 PRDs apply? Am I extending existing code or writing parallel implementations? If it feels like special-case handling, STOP.

## Pipeline Overview

```
Clef Source → CCS → PSG (Nanopass Pipeline) → Alex/Zipper → MLIR → LLVM → Native Binary
```

### PSG Nanopass Pipeline

> See `docs/PSG_Nanopass_Architecture.md` for details.

```
Phase 1: Structural Construction    SynExpr → PSG with nodes + ChildOf edges
Phase 2: Symbol Correlation         + FSharpSymbol attachments (via FCS)
Phase 3: Soft-Delete Reachability   + IsReachable marks (structure preserved!)
Phase 4: Typed Tree Overlay         + Type, Constraints, SRTP resolution (Zipper)
Phase 5+: Enrichment Nanopasses     + def-use edges, operation classification, etc.
```

Key: Soft-delete reachability (never hard-delete — zipper needs full structure). Typed tree overlay captures SRTP resolution into PSG. Each phase inspectable via `-k`.

### Core Components

- **FCS** (`/src/Core/FCS/`) — Parsing, type checking, semantic analysis. Both syntax and typed trees used.
- **PSG** (`/src/Core/PSG/`) — Unified IR correlating syntax with semantics. THE single source of truth downstream.
- **Nanopasses** (`/src/Core/PSG/Nanopass/`) — Single-purpose PSG enrichment passes.
- **Alex** (`/src/Alex/`) — Zipper traversal + XParsec pattern matching + platform Bindings → MLIR.
  - `Traversal/` — Zipper and XParsec-based PSG traversal
  - `Pipeline/` — Orchestration, lowering, optimization
  - `Bindings/` — Platform-aware code generation
  - `CodeGeneration/` — Type mapping, MLIR builders
- **CCS** (external: `~/repos/clef/src/Compiler/NativeTypedTree/Expressions/`) — NTUKind type universe, intrinsic operations, platform resolution.

### The Zipper + XParsec + Bindings Model

NO central dispatch hub. The model:

```
Zipper.create(psg, entryNode) → fold over structure → at each node: XParsec pattern → MLIR emission → MLIR Builder accumulates
```

- **Zipper**: Bidirectional PSG traversal, purely navigational, carries state
- **XParsec**: Composable pattern matchers on PSG structure, local decisions
- **Bindings**: Platform-specific MLIR, organized by (OSFamily, Architecture, BindingFunction), are DATA not routing
- **MLIR Builder**: Where centralization correctly occurs (output, not dispatch)

## Negative Examples (Real Mistakes)

1. **Symbol-name matching in codegen** — `match symbolName with "Console.Write" -> ...` couples codegen to namespaces. Use PSG node types and CCS intrinsic markers instead.

2. **Unmarked intrinsics** — Operations must be defined in CCS `Intrinsics.fs` to be recognized. If it's not there, Alex can't generate code for it.

3. **Nanopass logic in codegen** — Don't import nanopass modules or build indices during MLIR generation. Nanopasses run before; codegen consumes the enriched PSG.

4. **Mutable state in codegen** — Mutable variable handling belongs in PSG nanopasses, not in a `GenerationContext`.

5. **Central dispatch hub** — Handler registries routing on node kinds (PSGEmitter, PSGScribe — removed twice). Zipper folds, XParsec matches locally, Bindings provide implementations.

6. **Hard-deleting unreachable nodes** — Breaks typed tree zipper. Use soft-delete (IsReachable = false).

7. **Mixing nanopass scopes** — Pipe operators (`|>`) use `ReducePipeOperators`. SRTP is separate. Don't mix.

8. **BCL/runtime dependencies** — Types and operations are CCS intrinsics (compiler-level), not library code.

## Build & Test

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Build compiler
cd /home/hhh/repos/Composer/src && dotnet build

# Compile a sample
cd /home/hhh/repos/Composer/samples/console/FidelityHelloWorld/01_HelloWorldDirect
/home/hhh/repos/Composer/src/bin/Debug/net10.0/Composer compile HelloWorld.fidproj

# Execute and validate
./HelloWorld

# Keep intermediates for debugging
Composer compile HelloWorld.fidproj -k
```

### Regression Runner (PRIMARY)

```bash
cd /home/hhh/repos/Composer/tests/regression
dotnet fsi Runner.fsx                              # Full suite
dotnet fsi Runner.fsx -- --parallel --verbose       # Fast + detailed
dotnet fsi Runner.fsx -- --sample 05_AddNumbers     # Specific sample
```

A change is NOT complete until the regression runner passes AND binaries execute correctly.

### Sample Progression

| Sample | Tests |
|--------|-------|
| `01_HelloWorldDirect` | Static strings, basic Console calls |
| `02_HelloWorldSaturated` | Let bindings, string interpolation |
| `03_HelloWorldHalfCurried` | Pipe operators, function values |
| `04_HelloWorldFullCurried` | Full currying, Result.map, lambdas |
| `TimeLoop` | Mutable state, while loops, Sleep |

### Intermediate Artifacts

After any runner run, intermediates are at `samples/console/FidelityHelloWorld/<sample>/targets/intermediates/`:

| Artifact | Stage |
|----------|-------|
| `01_psg0.json` | Initial PSG with reachability |
| `02_intrinsic_recipes.json` | Intrinsic elaboration recipes |
| `03_psg1.json` | PSG after intrinsic fold-in |
| `04_saturation_recipes.json` | Baker saturation recipes |
| `05_psg2.json` | Final saturated PSG to Alex |
| `06_coeffects.json` | Coeffect analysis |
| `07_output.mlir` | MLIR output |
| `08_output.ll` | LLVM IR |

When debugging, inspect in pipeline order to find WHERE a bug originates.
