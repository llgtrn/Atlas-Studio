# DUUMBI-686 Docs Audit

## Summary

Issue #686 reconciles the legacy source-repo documentation surfaces with the
canonical public documentation site in `hgahub/duumbi-web/docs`.

The public source of truth is now `duumbi-web/docs/src/content/docs/`. The
source repo keeps internal architecture, automation, testing, provider catalog
source material, and implementation evidence. The old mdbook tree under
`sites/docs/` is removed after its useful reader-facing content is represented
in the canonical docs site.

Canonical docs implementation evidence:

- `hgahub/duumbi-web` main commit
  `265195bd8b778409a5fafa199cac9da017a44d3d`
- `npm run build` from `/Users/heizergabor/space/hgahub/duumbi-web/docs`
  succeeded after the docs updates.

## Routing Rules

| Audience | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Public DUUMBI user | Rewrite or migrate to `duumbi-web/docs/src/content/docs/` |
| Contributor or implementation agent | Keep in `hgahub/duumbi/docs/` when current |
| Historical implementation evidence | Keep internal and label as historical when referenced |
| Generated or local cruft | Delete when present; keep `.gitignore` coverage |
| Obsolete mdbook content | Delete after canonical docs coverage exists |

| Source path | Audience | Action | Destination | Rationale | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sites/docs/src/SUMMARY.md` | Public docs reader | Delete | `duumbi-web/docs/astro.config.mjs` sidebar | Starlight sidebar replaces mdbook summary. | Sidebar includes migrated provider, Query, support, registry, and reference pages. |
| `sites/docs/src/introduction.md` | Public docs reader | Rewrite | `duumbi-web/docs/src/content/docs/getting-started/introduction.md` | Core product framing remains useful but provider and Query wording needed refresh. | Introduction describes semantic graph pipeline, Query-first workflow, and current direct providers. |
| `sites/docs/src/getting-started/installation.md` | Public docs reader | Rewrite | `duumbi-web/docs/src/content/docs/getting-started/installation.md` | Old install claims must not overstate `cargo install duumbi` while #687 is open. | Installation page uses source build guidance and marks packaged install as pending. |
| `sites/docs/src/getting-started/quickstart.md` | Public docs reader | Represent | `duumbi-web/docs/src/content/docs/getting-started/quickstart.md` | Existing canonical quickstart already covers first build flow. | Quickstart remains linked from sidebar and install page. |
| `sites/docs/src/getting-started/workspace.md` | Public docs reader | Represent | `duumbi-web/docs/src/content/docs/getting-started/quickstart.md`, `duumbi-web/docs/src/content/docs/guides/module-system.md` | Workspace concepts are covered by quickstart and module docs; no one-to-one page needed. | Audit records coverage; no active mdbook link remains. |
| `sites/docs/src/cli/overview.md` | Public docs reader | Rewrite | `duumbi-web/docs/src/content/docs/reference/cli.md` | CLI reference must reflect current provider, Query, registry, and dependency surfaces. | CLI page includes core, provider, Query/REPL, intent, dependency, registry, and Studio commands. |
| `sites/docs/src/cli/init.md` | Public docs reader | Merge | `duumbi-web/docs/src/content/docs/reference/cli.md`, quickstart | Command-specific mdbook page is better represented in compact reference and quickstart. | CLI page lists `duumbi init`; quickstart shows first use. |

| `sites/docs/src/cli/add.md` | Public docs reader | Rewrite | `duumbi-web/docs/src/content/docs/getting-started/first-ai-mutation.md`, `reference/cli.md` | Write-capable Agent behavior needs clear contrast with read-only Query. | Query guide and CLI reference distinguish Query, Agent, and Intent. |
| `sites/docs/src/cli/undo.md` | Public docs reader | Merge | `duumbi-web/docs/src/content/docs/reference/cli.md` | Command-specific mdbook page is stale duplication. | CLI page lists undo behavior. |
| `sites/docs/src/cli/studio.md` | Public docs reader | Merge | `duumbi-web/docs/src/content/docs/reference/cli.md` | Studio launch command belongs in compact CLI reference for now. | CLI page lists `duumbi studio [--port N]`. |

| `docs/.obsidian/` | None | Delete if present | None | Vault metadata does not belong in source repo docs. | No directory found in this worktree; `.gitignore` already covers `docs/.obsidian/`. |

## Deletion Preconditions

- Useful mdbook content is represented in canonical Starlight docs.
- Provider catalog, provider setup examples using the current `provider` field
  and explicit `duumbi provider add <type> <api_key_env>` syntax, Query-first
  guidance, installation constraints, and community/support paths are present
  in `duumbi-web/docs`.
- Active source-repo references no longer tell contributors to update
  `sites/docs/src/`.
- Search checks are recorded in implementation evidence.

## Follow-Up Items

- Add a dedicated public stdlib reference when the stdlib API surface is stable
  enough for preview documentation.
- Revisit public eval/result language after #689 lands current scaled eval
  evidence.
- Update installation docs again after #687 provides a verified packaged
  install channel.
