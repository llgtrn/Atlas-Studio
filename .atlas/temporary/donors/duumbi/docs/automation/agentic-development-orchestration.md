# DUUMBI Agentic Development Orchestration

> **Stage 6–9 manual Desktop handoff:** Stage 5 records the specification prompt on the
> GitHub issue and sends it once to Slack. The Owner submits it in Codex Desktop with
> `duumbi-spec-desktop`. The Grok VM specification worker is retired; no automatic spec
> task starts. See [manual handoff and migration](manual-spec-handoff.md).

This document records the repository-side implementation of the redesigned
DUUMBI intake-to-delivery workflow. The canonical operating model remains the
DUUMBI Agentic Development Runbook in the vault; these files are the executable
or source-repo contracts that support it.

## Source Of Truth

- GitHub Issues, PRs, CI, review threads, and Project V2 status hold execution
  state.
- Obsidian stores raw intake and durable knowledge.
- Slack is a notification, clarification, and approval surface. Idea intake uses
  Codex or Grok Bot (Stage 2), or manual Obsidian Inbox (Stage 3). GitHub Issues and
  Ideas Discussions are retired as independent intake sources. Stage 1 Slack
  intake was retired on 2026-09-11; stage numbers remain unchanged.
- Stage 3b calls DeepSeek for bounded Inbox preparation; Stage 4 calls Z.ai/Zhipu
  for bounded execution routing. Other gates have their documented model or
  dispatch policies. Spec and implementation work remain in Codex by default.
- The [shared intake contract](intake-contract.md) defines authoritative metadata,
  synchronization, ownership, and the clarification loop. The portable
  [Grok recipe](grok-intake-skill.md) uses the same contract; see
  [Grok setup](grok-intake-setup.md) for account-specific configuration.

## Skills Added Or Updated

- `duumbi-inbox-enrichment` normalizes manually edited Inbox notes and detects
  duplicates before Stage 4 triage.
- `duumbi-delivery-autopilot` coordinates a single `Spec Needed` issue through
  Stage 6, Stage 7 AI gate, Stage 8, Stage 9 AI gate, and Stage 10 entry.
- `duumbi-codex-intake` searches active Inbox,
  Processed Inbox, Atlas, and GitHub before creating duplicate notes.
- `duumbi-spec-review` and `duumbi-tech-spec-review` now support bounded AI
  gates while still failing closed on missing checks, scope, unresolved
  findings, or unmerged spec PR readiness. Spec gates have no required
  automated reviewer by default; Greptile is manual-only and reserved for the
  final implementation PR.
- `duumbi-closure` runs after a verified merge or equivalent completion
  evidence to close the loop across GitHub, source surfaces, Inbox notes, and
  durable knowledge sync decisions.

## Workflows Added

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `inbox-enrichment-dispatch.yml` | Vault capture event, hourly at minute 17 UTC, manual | Uses DeepSeek to enrich up to five `captured` Inbox notes serially in `duumbi-vault/main`, then posts Slack only when a vault commit is created. |
| `triage-queue-refill.yml` | every 4 hours, manual | Reads Project V2 `Needs Human Acceptance` count and uses a bounded Z.ai/Zhipu-backed Stage 4 triage refill when fewer than three issues are waiting. |
| `clarification-routing.yml` | issue comment created, manual | Filters for explicit `@Clarification` comments on `needs-human-review` issues, uses DeepSeek for synthesis, posts a GitHub comment, and sends Slack. |
| `spec-ai-gate.yml` | manual, repository dispatch | Records Stage 7/9 AI gate decisions and dispatches `stage-approval.yml` for clean approvals. |
| `ready-for-build-handoff.yml` | `tech-spec-approved` label, `issues.reopened`, combined-spec PR merge, hourly, manual | Sends the Stage 10 Slack handoff when an issue becomes Ready for Build, and posts a per-occurrence Project Status correction/entry card after reopen or a merged two-file PRODUCT+TECHNICAL spec PR. Slack `blocks` stay off until `DUUMBI_PROJECT_STATUS_SLACK_BUTTONS=true`. |
| `project-status.yml` | `project-status` repository dispatch, manual | Sets DUUMBI Project V2 Status to Ready for Build without merging a spec PR. Sibling of `stage-approval.yml`; never calls `pulls.merge` or `validateAndMergeSpecPr`. |
| `ralph-cycle-approval-request.yml` | `needs-cycle-approval` label, twice daily, manual, repository dispatch | Sends Stage 10 bounded-cycle resource authorization Slack notifications; decisions are recorded through `stage-10-authorization.yml`. |
| `implementation-review-request.yml` | `needs-review` label, PR ready/labeled, twice daily, manual, repository dispatch | Sends implementation review handoff notifications with linked spec and PR evidence. |
| `stage12-closure-dispatch.yml` | merged PR, manual | Dispatches `duumbi-closure` after a developer merges the implementation PR. It does not merge, close issues, or claim `Done` itself. |

## Slack Bridge Routing

`scripts/slack-approval-bridge` now dispatches by stage:

- Stage 5, 7, and 9 buttons use `stage-approval`.
- Stage 10 resource buttons use `stage-10-authorization` when the payload has
  `action_type: "stage_10_authorization"`; legacy stage-only buttons are
  normalized into the same workflow.
- Project Status buttons use `action_type: "project_status"` → `project-status`
  → `project-status.yml`. The Function revision that understands this route
  must be deployed before live Slack `blocks` are enabled. Until then, keep
  repository variable `DUUMBI_PROJECT_STATUS_SLACK_BUTTONS` unset/false so
  Ready-for-Build and correction/entry posts stay text-only.
- Stage 11 merge, request-changes, clarification, and abandon decisions are made
  directly by the human reviewer in GitHub.
- Slack message/global shortcuts are unsupported and do not dispatch workflows.

Unknown stages fall back to `stage-approval`, where unsupported stages fail
closed. Do not ship live `project_status` buttons against an undeployed
Function: unknown `action_type` would otherwise fall through to
`stage-approval`.

## Required Configuration

- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: Slack bot token for notification posts.
- `SLACK_REVIEW_CHANNEL_ID`: human review channel.
- `DUUMBI_PROJECT_STATUS_SLACK_BUTTONS`: optional repository variable; set to
  `true` only after the Slack approval Function routes `project_status`.
  Default unset/false keeps Project Status Slack posts text-only.
- `DUUMBI_AGENT_DISPATCH_CHANNEL_ID`: optional agent dispatch channel; falls
  back to `SLACK_REVIEW_CHANNEL_ID`.
- `GH_PROJECT_PAT`: PAT that can read and update GitHub Project V2 and write
  enrichment commits to `duumbi-vault/main`.
- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`: DeepSeek API key used by
  `inbox-enrichment-dispatch.yml` for one-note Inbox preparation and by
  `clarification-routing.yml` for explicit `@Clarification` synthesis.
- `DEEPSEEK_MODEL`: optional repository variable for DeepSeek-backed
  automation; defaults to `deepseek-v4-pro`.
- `ZHIPUAI_API_KEY`: Z.ai/Zhipu API key used by
  `triage-queue-refill.yml` when the `Needs Human Acceptance` queue is below
  target.
- `ZHIPU_MODEL`: optional repository variable for the triage refill model;
  defaults to `glm-5.2`.
- `DUUMBI_PROJECT_NUMBER`: repository variable for the Project V2 number used by
  `triage-queue-refill.yml`.
- `DUUMBI_PROJECT_OWNER`: optional repository variable; defaults to repository
  owner.
- `DUUMBI_PROJECT_OWNER_TYPE`: optional repository variable; use `user` for a
  personal-account project and `organization` for an org-owned project. When
  omitted, the workflow infers the repository owner type from the GitHub event.

## Clarification Routing Policy

`clarification-routing.yml` is registered on all created issue comments and
filters in code. It ignores general `@Codex` issue comments. It
only processes comments whose visible text starts with `@Clarification`, and
only when the target issue still carries the `needs-human-review` Stage 5 label.
The workflow calls DeepSeek for a bounded JSON clarification synthesis, writes
the synthesis as an issue comment, and sends a Slack notification when Slack
secrets are configured. It does not update labels, Project V2 status, specs,
PRs, or source code.

## Inbox Enrichment Policy

`inbox-enrichment-dispatch.yml` selects at most five notes serially whose top-level
frontmatter is `intake_status: captured`, regardless of Codex/Grok/Obsidian source.
It preserves the original input and ownership, replacing only its delimited
preparation block. Legacy processed tags do not determine eligibility.

A usable note becomes `ready_for_triage`. Essential missing human intent becomes
`needs_clarification`, with a reason and 1–3 questions. After the vault push, Slack
links the note, identifies its owner, and gives a Codex/Grok continuation prompt.
The owner answers in the same note and returns it to `captured` when resolved.
Waiting notes do not trigger more model calls or duplicate notifications.

No candidate means no model call or Slack post. Failed notifications are visible
in the workflow summary/metrics; do not re-enrich a waiting note to resend one.
Stage 3b never creates GitHub issues, specs, PRs, Atlas notes, or implementation.

## Stage 4 Refill LLM Policy

`triage-queue-refill.yml` runs at most six times per day. It first reads Project
V2 with `GH_PROJECT_PAT`; if at least three open issues are already in
`Needs Human Acceptance`, it exits without calling a model or posting Slack.

When refill is needed, the workflow checks out `duumbi-vault`, builds bounded
context from `ready_for_triage` Inbox notes, Project V2 issue state, and
active Atlas/runbook docs, and asks Z.ai/Zhipu for one strict JSON decision:
`route_existing_issue`, `create_issue`, `needs_clarification`, or `no_action`.
Only `route_existing_issue` and `create_issue` perform GitHub writes, and at
most one issue is queued per run. Both actions require an exact source path
matching an Inbox note supplied to the model; GitHub-only or fabricated sources
are rejected before writes. Existing Todo issues may be reused only for work
represented by an Inbox note. Ideas Discussions are no longer fetched as an
intake queue. GitHub remains execution state and duplicate-check context.

With no ready note it exits before requiring an LLM key. After successful routing,
it marks the selected note `triaged` and archives it with issue evidence. Stage 3b
and Stage 4 share the `duumbi-vault-intake` concurrency group. The scheduled refill
handles execution work; the manual `duumbi-triage` skill handles knowledge,
duplicate, defer, and no-action dispositions. See the shared contract for rollout
and partial-write recovery.

All GitHub writes use `GH_PROJECT_PAT` rather than `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so adding the
existing `needs-human-review` label can trigger the separate Human Acceptance
Slack gate. The refill workflow itself does not post Slack notifications; this
avoids duplicate messages. Clarification routing uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` because it
only comments on the already-routed issue.

Default model: `glm-5.2` through the Z.ai/Zhipu chat completions endpoint:
`https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/chat/completions`. The workflow records token
counts when the provider returns usage metadata, but cost estimation is
intentionally left null until stable pricing for this routed model is documented
in the repository.

## Gate Policy

Review service selection is governed by
`docs/automation/code-review-policy.md`:

- Codex self-review is mandatory before agents mark work ready, approve an AI
  gate, or recommend implementation merge readiness.
- Codex review via `@chatgpt-codex-connector` is the required automated
  reviewer on the final implementation PR.
- Quick low-cost reviewers (MiniMax, DeepSeek Pro, Grok Build, Cursor BugBot)
  are optional and advisory on non-final PRs; they are never a DUUMBI gate.
- Greptile is manual-only, quota-limited, and reserved for the final
  implementation PR when an explicitly requested deep review is justified. Do
  not include Greptile in `DUUMBI_REQUIRED_SPEC_REVIEWERS`.

Stage 7 and Stage 9 AI gates may approve only when:

- the PR is spec-only
- the PR is open, non-draft, and ready for approval merge
- actual non-dismissed review submissions exist for every configured required
  reviewer. By default `DUUMBI_REQUIRED_SPEC_REVIEWERS` is empty and no
  automated reviewer is required; repositories can opt in with a
  comma-separated low-cost reviewer list
- reviewer-request workflow success does not count as review evidence
- automated reviews and human reviews have no blocking `CHANGES_REQUESTED`
  decision
- every review thread is resolved, including threads that became outdated after
  a fix
- relevant checks are passing or explicitly not applicable
- no product, architecture, security, migration, cost, scope, or verification
  question remains
- the proposed spec stays inside the accepted issue scope

Stage 7 and Stage 9 human Slack approvals are merge finalizers for file-based
specs. The review request workflows send Slack approval cards only after the
linked PRODUCT.md or TECHNICAL.md PR is review-clean. Review-clean means the
PR has green checks, no blocking review decisions, no unresolved review
threads, and submissions from any configured required reviewers. Approval then
revalidates the exact PR, squash-merges the spec artifact with non-closing issue
references, records the stage decision, and advances the issue to the next
workflow state. If the PR is draft, dirty, not spec-only, missing required
reviewer submissions, or has unresolved review threads, the workflow fails
closed or defers notification.

The Stage 5 approval prompt starts no work by itself. The Owner submits it in Codex
Desktop to draft and review product/technical specifications (Stages 6–9), ending in a
spec-only PR for human review and merge. This handoff does not authorize automatic merge
or Stage 10. The broader delivery-autopilot requires a separate explicit request. Existing
Stage 7/9 human approval workflows retain the merge-gate behavior described above.

`ready-for-build-handoff.yml` is the fallback and retry path for the Stage 10
Slack handoff. It posts when `tech-spec-approved` is added and also scans for
open issues that are already labeled `tech-spec-approved` or whose Project V2
Status is `Ready for Build`. It records
`<!-- duumbi-ready-for-build-slack-notified:v1 issue=N -->` on the issue after a
successful Slack post, so reruns and scheduled scans do not duplicate the same
handoff. A separate per-occurrence correction/entry path posts after
`issues.reopened` or a merged two-file `PRODUCT.md`+`TECHNICAL.md` spec PR
when DUUMBI Status is Done or Spec Needed; the Ready-for-Build v1 marker does
not suppress that card. Hourly cron does not scan every Spec Needed issue for
correction cards. Slack `blocks` are attached only when
`DUUMBI_PROJECT_STATUS_SLACK_BUTTONS=true` after the Function routes
`project_status`. This keeps Slack delivery independent from
`stage-approval.yml` merge or validation failures while preserving GitHub
Issues and Project V2 as the source of truth.

Stage 11 merge remains human-authorized. The merge workflow requires explicit
human decision, Stage 11 review artifact, green checks, a clean or handled
Codex (`@chatgpt-codex-connector`) review, and an open non-draft implementation
PR. It uses squash merge by default and emits the Stage 12 closure prompt
after merge.

## Metrics And Privacy

All new workflows write metadata-only metrics artifacts. They must not store raw
Slack payloads, issue bodies, comments, prompts from users, model completions,
provider payloads, credentials, or broad logs. The Stage 4 refill workflow may
send bounded triage context to Z.ai/Zhipu, but its metrics artifact records only
metadata, counts, provider name/model, token usage, estimated cost, and
warnings.

Slack capability URLs, including `response_url`, stay inside the Slack bridge
function and are not forwarded through GitHub `repository_dispatch` payloads.
GitHub workflow summaries intentionally omit generated agent prompts that
could contain user-provided content.


## Stage 5 clarification and rejection details

Stage 5 Slack **Needs Clarification** and **Reject** collect a rationale before
submitting a decision. Clarification additionally requires the blocking question
and the responsible GitHub username. The same requirements apply to manual
`stage-approval.yml` dispatches (`rationale`, `clarification_question`,
`clarification_owner`). Validation precedes writes. Opening/cancelling the form
has no side effects on GitHub.

The workflow records the supplied question and owner in the decision comment,
keeps `needs-human-review`, and requests Project status `Needs Clarification`.
The owner is recorded/mentioned, not automatically added to issue assignees.
They answer on the issue with an `@Clarification` comment. The existing synthesis
is advisory; it does not move status or grant approval. Accept requires a new
human decision and removes `needs-clarification`; Reject records the rationale,
closes the issue, and removes the review/clarification labels.

Repeated submissions reuse the same evidence; different clarification rounds
retain distinct comments. Stale decisions cannot move an accepted/closed issue
backward. Project and Slack operations retain their existing best-effort failure
reporting, so inspect the workflow result and Project state when either fails.

See [bridge rollout instructions](../../scripts/slack-approval-bridge/README.md#rollout)
for the Azure `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` prerequisite, production deployment, and live
smoke test. The interactivity URL is unchanged.

## Developer-selected Inbox priority

`intake-stage5.yml` accepts one exact `intake_id` through workflow_dispatch or the signed
Slack `/duumbi-triage <intake_id>` command. It routes a ready_for_triage note through the
Stage 4 queue writer to Stage 5 without the scheduled refill threshold or another model
call. It preserves Human Acceptance, issue identity and the Inbox archive lifecycle.
See [setup and recovery](targeted-intake-stage5.md).
