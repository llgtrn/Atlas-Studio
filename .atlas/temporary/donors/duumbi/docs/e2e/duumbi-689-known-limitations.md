# DUUMBI-689 Preview Known Limitations

Related to #689.

Update: [DUUMBI-780](duumbi-780-process-evidence.md) adds automated bounded
process verification for new HTTP/SQLite/JSON benchmark and replay attempts.
The historical results below remain unchanged; they did not run that verifier.

The scaled intent-execute smoke evidence from 2026-06-16 should be treated as
preview risk evidence, not as a passing benchmark claim.

Evidence source:

- `docs/e2e/results/duumbi-689-scaled-smoke-20260616.md`
- Command: `duumbi benchmark --suite scaled --smoke --provider minimax:auto:primary:MINIMAX_API_KEY --attempts 1`

## What Passed

- The benchmark surface now has an opt-in scaled suite.
- The scaled smoke subset can select multi-function, cross-module, and
  HTTP/SQLite/JSON evidence tasks.
- The report distinguishes first-pass success, repair attempts, provider usage
  availability, failure categories, dominant evidence signals, and process
  evidence gaps.

## What Failed

- `scaled_math_pipeline` failed verifier evidence: 0/3 tests passed.
- `scaled_cross_module_stats` failed verifier evidence: 0/3 tests passed.
- `scaled_http_sqlite_json` was not counted as a pass because the current
  verifier does not check HTTP JSON payload semantics.

## What Preview Users Should Not Infer

- Do not infer that the intent write path reliably handles application-scale
  or service-like tasks.
- Do not infer that cross-module generated programs pass reliably under the
  current provider/prompt path.
- Do not infer HTTP + SQLite + JSON generated-service reliability from the
  scaled corpus entry alone. The repository has a flagship reference example,
  but this smoke run did not prove generated service behavior.
- Do not make cost claims from this run. Provider usage fields were present but
  token/cost values were unavailable.

## Top Failure Patterns To Feed Back

1. Scaled i64 task verifier failures need sampled generated-workspace evidence
   so follow-up work can distinguish wrong decomposition, missing exports,
   cross-module call resolution, and logic mistakes.
2. HTTP + SQLite + JSON now has a bounded process evidence checker (#780);
   generated-service reliability still requires live authoring evidence.
3. Provider usage telemetry needs integration into benchmark results before
   preview cost claims are supported.

Generated-service reliability is still not proven by offline fixtures. The other
implementation's live MiniMax run on 2026-09-10 hit HTTP 429 before graph
generation (recorded in the [#780 decision](https://github.com/hgahub/duumbi/issues/780#issuecomment-5620459440)).
Only a live row with `evidence.status = passed` establishes an authoring success.
Generated solutions must guard `ResultUnwrap` with `ResultIsOk` (E034 in the write
path); the hand-written flagship graph does not and is only an API reference.
