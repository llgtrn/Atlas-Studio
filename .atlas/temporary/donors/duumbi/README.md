# DUUMBI

[![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/hgahub/duumbi/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/hgahub/duumbi)

> AI-first semantic graph compiler. Programs are stored as JSON-LD graphs — not text files. Describe a change in plain language; the toolchain validates, compiles, and links it to a native binary via Cranelift.

## How it works

Traditional compilers transform text → AST → machine code. DUUMBI skips the text entirely. Program logic lives as a typed semantic graph in JSON-LD format. An AI agent generates and mutates the graph; every mutation is validated before compilation. Syntax errors are structurally impossible.

```
.jsonld  →  Parser  →  Semantic Graph  →  Validator  →  Cranelift  →  binary
```

## Install

### Developer preview release

DUUMBI `v0.4.1-preview` is distributed as prebuilt GitHub Release archives for:

| Platform | Target | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| macOS Apple Silicon | `aarch64-apple-darwin` | Required preview target |
| Linux x86_64 | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | Required preview target |
| Linux ARM64 | `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` | Extra preview target |

macOS Intel (`x86_64-apple-darwin`) is not included in this developer preview.
Build from source on Intel Macs if needed. No macOS Intel preview archive is
published for this release path. Native Windows is unsupported; see the
[platform policy and archival source tag](#supported-platforms).

Preview write-path evidence is intentionally limited. The current scaled
intent-execute smoke notes are tracked in
[`docs/e2e/duumbi-689-known-limitations.md`](docs/e2e/duumbi-689-known-limitations.md).

Download the archive for your platform from the
[`v0.4.1-preview` release](https://github.com/hgahub/duumbi/releases/tag/v0.4.1-preview)
and verify it with the published checksum file:

For the archive install, Rust is not required to install DUUMBI itself. The
smoke test below runs `duumbi build` and `duumbi run`, so it still needs the
native build/link tools used when compiling DUUMBI programs: Xcode Command Line
Tools or an equivalent C compiler/linker on macOS, and `build-essential` or an
equivalent C compiler/linker on Linux. Linux systems also need the runtime
linker dependencies used by the DUUMBI C runtime, including libcurl.

```bash
DUUMBI_VERSION=v0.4.1-preview
DUUMBI_TARGET=<target>

curl -LO "https://github.com/hgahub/duumbi/releases/download/${DUUMBI_VERSION}/duumbi-${DUUMBI_VERSION}-${DUUMBI_TARGET}.tar.gz"
curl -LO "https://github.com/hgahub/duumbi/releases/download/${DUUMBI_VERSION}/checksums.txt"
shasum -a 256 --ignore-missing -c checksums.txt

tar xzf "duumbi-${DUUMBI_VERSION}-${DUUMBI_TARGET}.tar.gz"
export PATH="$PWD/duumbi-${DUUMBI_VERSION}-${DUUMBI_TARGET}:$PATH"

duumbi --version
duumbi init smoke
cd smoke
duumbi build
duumbi run
```

Keep the extracted release directory together. The CLI expects the packaged
`runtime/` tree beside the executable when linking native DUUMBI programs.

### Build from source

**Requirements:**

- Rust stable 1.95+ through `rustup` (required by the locked Cranelift dependencies).
- macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools or an equivalent C compiler/linker.
- Linux: `build-essential` or an equivalent C compiler/linker, plus libcurl
  development headers and library (`libcurl4-openssl-dev` on Ubuntu).
- Native development requires Linux or macOS; Windows is unsupported.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hgahub/duumbi.git
cd duumbi
cargo install --path .
```

## Quickstart

```bash
duumbi init myproject
cd myproject

duumbi build      # compile
duumbi run        # run the binary
duumbi check      # validate without compiling
duumbi describe   # human-readable pseudo-code
```

For a runnable reference program that combines HTTP, SQLite, and JSON, see
[`examples/flagship-http-sqlite-json/`](examples/flagship-http-sqlite-json/)
and the [examples guide](docs/examples.md).

## Query First

Use DUUMBI's interactive mode to ask read-only questions before requesting graph
changes. Query mode inspects the workspace and can explain what exists, where
behavior lives, and when a request should hand off to Agent or Intent.

Query requires an available LLM provider. Configure one in `.duumbi/config.toml`;
DUUMBI selects concrete models internally per task and agent.

```toml
[[providers]]
provider = "anthropic"           # or "openai"
role = "primary"
api_key_env = "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
```

Then start the interactive TUI:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

duumbi
```

Inside the TUI, Query is the default read-only mode. Use slash commands for
one-shot questions from any mode:

```text
/query "what functions exist?"
/ask "where does main behavior live?"
```

Query answers include metadata such as sources, confidence, model, and suggested
handoff when a write-capable Agent or Intent request is more appropriate.

---

## AI Mutation

After you understand the workspace, use Agent mode or `duumbi add` for bounded
write-capable graph changes:

```bash
duumbi add "change the constant 3 to 7"
duumbi add --yes "multiply instead of add"
duumbi undo   # restore the previous graph
```

Supported providers: **Anthropic**, **OpenAI**, **xAI Grok**, **OpenRouter**, and **MiniMax**.

## Build & test

```bash
cargo build
cargo test --all
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt
```

## Supported platforms

| Platform | Architecture | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| macOS | aarch64 (Apple Silicon) | Primary |
| macOS | x86_64 | Build from source; no current CI job |
| Linux | x86_64 | CI-tested |

Native Windows support has been retired to focus development and validation
resources on Linux and macOS. We may revisit it when the product is more mature;
there is no committed return date or WSL support commitment.

The final source snapshot with Windows support is preserved by the annotated tag
[`windows-support-final-2026-09-10`](https://github.com/hgahub/duumbi/tree/windows-support-final-2026-09-10)
at commit `52931c91d9fc6f7a541e1c250e0837a9980dd46b`. This is an archival source
snapshot, not a Windows binary release or an ongoing maintenance branch.
See [#800](https://github.com/hgahub/duumbi/issues/800) for the retirement decision.
