# DUUMBI — AI-First Semantic Graph Compiler

## About
Next-generation JSON-LD semantic graph compiler in Rust. Cranelift backend
for native code generation. petgraph for graph IR, serde_json for JSON-LD
parsing. AI agent graph mutation (OpenAI/Anthropic APIs), intent-driven
development, registry distribution, DUUMBI Studio web platform.

## Agent interaction style
- If the user writes in Hungarian, start with a natural everyday American
  English translation before answering.
- If the user writes in English, first provide a corrected, natural native
  American English version when wording can be improved.
- Be direct and evidence-aware: separate facts, assumptions, interpretations,
  uncertainty, and speculation when architecture or implementation risk matters.
- Challenge weak reasoning respectfully and concretely; prefer practical,
  maintainable solutions over clever but fragile ones.

## Build and test

Native DUUMBI development targets Linux and macOS. Windows support and its CI
runner were retired in #800 to reduce maintenance and validation cost. Do not
restore native Windows code or checks without a new product decision. The final
source snapshot is the immutable tag `windows-support-final-2026-09-10` at
`52931c91d9fc6f7a541e1c250e0837a9980dd46b`; this is not a maintained release.
Do not remove upstream Windows metadata from vendored sources or transitive
dependencies, or weaken generic path-security checks during platform cleanup.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions
Cloud Agents need **Rust 1.95+**. `edition = "2024"` only sets the parser floor
(1.85); the effective workspace MSRV comes from the locked `cranelift-* 0.135.1`
and `wasmtime-internal-core 48.0.1`, which declare `rust-version = "1.95.0"`.
The default Cloud image ships `rustc 1.83.0`, which cannot even parse
`Cargo.toml`. Verified working: 1.98.1.

`rust-toolchain.toml` selects the `stable` **channel** (plus rustfmt and clippy)
for every rustup user in this repo, not just Cloud Agents. It does not pin an
exact version, and the file alone never upgrades an already-installed, outdated
`stable` toolchain. The `.cursor/environment.json` install step refreshes it with
`rustup toolchain install stable`; outside Cloud, run `rustup update stable`
yourself when `rustc --version` reports below 1.95.

`.cursor/environment.json` is a repo-level Cursor config and takes precedence
over personal and team saved environments. Its install step also adds
`libcurl4-openssl-dev`, required to compile and link the DUUMBI C runtime
(`runtime/duumbi_runtime.c` includes `curl/curl.h`; `src/compiler/linker.rs`
links `-lcurl`), matching `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

Do not put `duumbi studio` in the environment `start` command. The repo root
is not a DUUMBI workspace; Studio expects an initialized `.duumbi` directory.
Start Studio only after `duumbi init` in a temp workspace, or from a checked-out
example that already has one.

## Code standards
- Use `thiserror` per module, `anyhow` at application boundaries only
- NEVER `.unwrap()` in library code; `.expect("invariant: ...")` for true invariants
- Propagate errors with `?`; provide `.context()` messages at module boundaries
- Newtypes for NodeId, EdgeId, GraphId — never raw u32/usize
- All public items need doc comments; use `#[must_use]` on Result-returning fns
- snake_case functions, PascalCase types, SCREAMING_SNAKE constants
- Prefer `petgraph::stable_graph::StableGraph` when indices must survive mutation
- Cranelift: use `FunctionBuilder` patterns, never raw `InstBuilder` calls
- Async code: tokio runtime, no blocking in async contexts
- Registry client: reqwest with retry, credentials from ~/.duumbi/credentials.toml

## Architecture notes
- Graph IR is the central data structure — all transformations are graph→graph
- Cranelift compilation: Graph → Cranelift IR (one function per subgraph)
- AI agents receive read-only graph snapshots, propose mutation plans
- MCP server exposes graph query/mutation as tools
- Intent system (Phase 5): YAML spec → Coordinator tasks → LLM mutations → Verifier
- Registry (Phase 7): publish/download modules as .tar.gz, SemVer resolution,
  lockfile v1 with integrity hashes, vendor layer for offline builds
- Dependency resolution: workspace → vendor → cache → registry (E011 if not found)

## Provider and model UX
- Prefer provider setup flows that collect credentials and verify access; do not
  ask users to choose or maintain a default model unless the task explicitly
  concerns backward compatibility or low-level config editing.
- Keep model choice internal to the model catalog, routing inputs, or performance
  knowledge. When changing provider behavior, update CLI, REPL/TUI, Studio, config
  examples, tests, and docs together so `/provider` remains the user-facing entry
  point and `/model` stays compatibility-only.

## REPL/TUI UX
- Keep Query mode read-only by default; require explicit Agent or Intent mode for
  graph mutation, filesystem writes, or workspace changes.
- TUI panels should stay quiet, bounded, and keyboard-complete: no startup
  provider warnings during unrelated flows, no clipped prompts, no duplicate
  hints, and `Esc` must close the active panel consistently.
- For REPL/TUI changes, add focused state-machine tests and run at least one
  manual smoke path for the changed interaction, including provider/no-provider
  behavior when relevant.

## CLI commands (Phase 7 + 12)
- `duumbi mcp` — start the MCP server (JSON-RPC over stdio, 10 tools)
- `duumbi search <query>` — search modules in configured registries
- `duumbi publish [--registry R] [--dry-run] [-y]` — package and upload module
- `duumbi yank <@scope/name@version> [--registry R] [-y]` — mark version as yanked
- `duumbi deps install [--frozen]` — resolve and download all deps, update lockfile
- `duumbi deps add <@scope/name[@ver]> [--registry R]` — add registry dependency
- `duumbi deps update [name]` — update to latest compatible versions
- `duumbi deps vendor [--all] [--include "pattern"]` — copy deps to vendor/
- `duumbi deps audit` — verify lockfile integrity hashes
- `duumbi deps tree [--depth N]` — display dependency tree
- `duumbi registry add|list|remove|default|login|logout` — manage registries
- `duumbi upgrade` — migrate Phase 4-5 workspace to Phase 7 format
- `duumbi provider list|add|remove|set` — manage LLM provider configurations
