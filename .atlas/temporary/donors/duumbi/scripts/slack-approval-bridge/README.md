# Slack Approval Bridge

Azure Function that bridges Slack interactive button clicks to DUUMBI GitHub
Actions workflows via `repository_dispatch`.

Clicking **Approve**, **Request Changes**, or **Needs Clarification** in a
DUUMBI Slack notification routes to a deterministic GitHub Action instead of
launching an agent directly. Stage 5 Needs Clarification and Reject collect
required details in a modal before submitting the decision. Slack idea intake was retired on 2026-09-11;
message and global shortcuts are unsupported. Submit ideas through Codex intake
or the Obsidian Inbox.
Existing Stage 5, Stage 7, and Stage 9 buttons continue to route to
`stage-approval.yml`. Stage 10 resource authorization buttons that include
`action_type: "stage_10_authorization"` route to `stage-10-authorization.yml`;
legacy Stage 10 payloads are normalized into that same workflow. Stage 11 merge
or status decisions are handled directly by the human reviewer in GitHub.
For file-based Stage 7 and Stage 9 spec approvals, `stage-approval.yml`
revalidates the linked spec PR and squash-merges it before advancing the issue.

## Architecture

```text
Slack button click
  → Slack sends interaction payload to Azure Function URL
      → Function verifies Slack signing secret
        → Function POSTs repository_dispatch to GitHub
        → the stage-specific GitHub Actions workflow runs deterministically
          → Posts decision comment, updates labels/status when available
            → Notifies Slack with result
```

## Dispatch Routing

The bridge chooses the repository dispatch event from the button payload:

| Payload | Dispatch event | Workflow |
|---|---|---|
| stage `5`, `7`, `9` | `stage-approval` | `stage-approval.yml` |
| `10` + `action_type: "stage_10_authorization"` | `stage-10-authorization` | `stage-10-authorization.yml` |
| `10` without `action_type` | `stage-10-authorization` | `stage-10-authorization.yml` |
| `action_type: "project_status"` | `project-status` | `project-status.yml` |

Unknown stage values fall back to `stage-approval`, where unsupported stages fail
closed.

The bridge does not forward Slack `response_url` capability URLs or raw Slack
message text in `repository_dispatch` payloads. It posts immediate Slack
follow-up messages from the function process and passes channel/thread
identifiers to GitHub workflows for agent handoff.

## Infrastructure

Ownership is split, and the split matters:

| Layer | Owner | How it changes |
|---|---|---|
| Function App, plan, storage, app settings, DNS | [duumbi-infra](https://github.com/hgahub/duumbi-infra) (`stack-platform.ts`) | `pulumi up` |
| Function code (this directory) | this repository | `.github/workflows/deploy-slack-bridge.yml`, or `func azure functionapp publish` |

Pulumi never deploys the code. The infra creates:

- Azure Function App (Consumption plan, Node.js 22, West Europe)
- App Settings: `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_REPO`,
  `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`
- DNS CNAME: `slack-bridge.duumbi.dev` → Function App hostname (optional)

Secrets are managed via Doppler → Azure Key Vault (existing pipeline).

### `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE` is load-bearing

The published code is uploaded as a zip to `/home/data/SitePackages` and is
only mounted while `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE=1` is set. `stack-platform.ts`
declares the app settings as a complete list, so any `pulumi up` on the
Function App replaces them: if that setting is not declared there, the
deployed code silently disappears and every Slack button gets HTTP 404.
This happened between 2026-09-07 (token rotation) and 2026-09-09.

## Local Development

```sh
cd scripts/slack-approval-bridge
npm install
npm test
func start
```

Use ngrok or Slack's socket mode to test locally.

## Deployment

`.github/workflows/deploy-slack-bridge.yml` runs the tests and publishes this
directory to `func-duumbi-slack-bridge` on every push to `main` that touches
`scripts/slack-approval-bridge/**`, and on `workflow_dispatch`.

### Deploy authentication (OIDC)

The deploy job stores **no credential**. It runs in the `production`
environment, GitHub signs a token for that run, and Entra ID exchanges it for a
~1 hour Azure credential — but only when the run's subject claim matches the
federated credential declared in
[duumbi-infra](https://github.com/hgahub/duumbi-infra) `stack-platform.ts`:

```text
repo:hgahub/duumbi:environment:production
```

A run from another branch, a fork, or another repository presents a different
subject and receives no token. The identity holds *Website Contributor scoped to
the Function App resource alone*, so it can publish and restart the bridge and
nothing else.

Three repository **variables** carry the identifiers (not secrets — without the
matching subject claim they grant nothing); the deploy job warns and skips when
`AZURE_CLIENT_ID` is absent:

| Variable | Source |
|---|---|
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | `pulumi stack output slackBridgeDeployClientId` |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | `pulumi stack output slackBridgeDeployTenantId` |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | `pulumi stack output slackBridgeDeploySubscriptionId` |

Renaming the `production` environment, or deploying from a job without it,
breaks the subject match — update the federated credential in duumbi-infra
first.

Manual deployment (same result, needs Azure Functions Core Tools):

```sh
cd scripts/slack-approval-bridge
npm ci --omit=dev
func azure functionapp publish func-duumbi-slack-bridge --javascript
```

`--javascript` is required: a clean checkout has no `local.settings.json`, so
Core Tools cannot infer the worker runtime and fails with "Can't determine
project language from files".

### Health check

```sh
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -X POST \
  https://func-duumbi-slack-bridge.azurewebsites.net/api/slack-approval
```

`401` is healthy — the request is unsigned, so the function itself rejects it.
`404` means the host loaded no functions at all; see
`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE` above. The deploy workflow runs this check after
every publish.

### Function-first Project Status buttons (DUUMBI-789)

Do **not** post live Slack `blocks` for Project Status until this Function
revision is deployed to `func-duumbi-slack-bridge` and
`action_type: "project_status"` dispatches `project-status` (not
`stage-approval`).

Rollout:

1. Merge the Function + `project-status.yml` code with repository variable
   `DUUMBI_PROJECT_STATUS_SLACK_BUTTONS` unset or `false` (default: buttons
   off; Ready-for-Build and correction/entry posts stay text-only).
2. Deploy the Function with the command above, or by merging a bridge change
   to `main` so `deploy-slack-bridge.yml` publishes it.
3. Verify a signed `project_status` click (or a local `node --test` plus a
   Function smoke) routes to `project-status`.
4. Only then set `DUUMBI_PROJECT_STATUS_SLACK_BUTTONS=true` so new Slack
   cards include **Set Ready for Build** / **Undo Done**.

Rollback:

1. Set `DUUMBI_PROJECT_STATUS_SLACK_BUTTONS` to `false` (or unset it) so new
   posts are text-only.
2. Revert or disable Function routing if needed.

Do not document "merge workflows first, Function later" as an acceptable
state for **live buttons**. Workflows may merge first only while the
enablement variable stays off.

Manual Project Status fallback (no Slack thread): run
`.github/workflows/project-status.yml` with `decision=ready-for-build` and
the issue number. Reviewer identity is `github.actor` when the reviewer
input is omitted. That path posts channel-only to `SLACK_REVIEW_CHANNEL_ID`.

## Slack App Configuration

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) → DUUMBI app
2. **Interactivity & Shortcuts** → toggle **On**
3. Set **Request URL** to the Function URL (e.g. `https://func-duumbi-slack-bridge.azurewebsites.net/api/slack-approval`)
4. Remove any old DUUMBI idea-capture shortcuts. Keep interactivity enabled for approval buttons.
5. Save Changes

## App Settings

| Setting | Source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` | Slack app → Basic Information → Signing Secret | Verify Slack requests |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub → Settings → PATs | Trigger `repository_dispatch` |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | Static: `hgahub/duumbi` | Target repository |
| `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE` | Static: `1` | Mounts the published zip from `/home/data/SitePackages`; without it the host serves no functions |

## Fallback

If the function is unavailable, Slack notifications include workflow fallback
links where decisions can be triggered directly from the GitHub Actions UI.
Stage 5, Stage 7, and Stage 9 approvals use `stage-approval.yml`; Stage 10
resource authorization uses `stage-10-authorization.yml`; Project Status
uses `project-status.yml`. Stage 11 merge, request-changes, clarification,
and abandon decisions are made directly in GitHub by the human reviewer.

## Stage 5 decision forms

Stage 5 **Needs Clarification** and **Reject** buttons now open a modal. Opening
or cancelling the form makes no GitHub change. Both require a rationale.
Clarification also requires a blocking question and a responsible GitHub username
(with or without `@`). The username is recorded and mentioned in the issue's
GitHub decision comment; it does not alter issue assignees or map Slack identities.
Reject's form submission is the confirmation that the issue should close.

The signed `view_submission` uses the existing `/api/slack-approval` interactivity
URL. The bridge validates input, awaits GitHub repository-dispatch acceptance
within a bounded timeout, and preserves the form on validation/API errors.
Timeouts have an uncertain delivery outcome: check Actions before retrying. A
stable view ID plus decision details identifies retries in the decision comment.
The success modal confirms dispatch only; the workflow posts the durable outcome.
No raw Slack message or response URL is forwarded.

The workflow also validates manual/repository dispatches before writes. Required
manual fields for Stage 5 are `rationale` for `reject`, and `rationale`,
`clarification_question`, `clarification_owner` for `needs-clarification`.
Accept and Reject remove a stale `needs-clarification` label. Clarification keeps
`needs-human-review`; the owner continues with an `@Clarification` issue comment.
Synthesis remains advisory and does not automatically approve the issue.
New decisions require an open issue with `needs-human-review`; historical retries
cannot move an issue backward after acceptance/closure.

### Rollout

1. Configure and deploy the bot token through **duumbi-infra Pulumi**, not
   Azure Portal. Its `platform` stack must read `slackBotToken` via
   `config.requireSecret` and declare `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` in the Function App
   settings. Use the same Slack app's Bot User OAuth Token. Enter it only through
   `bash scripts/configure-slack-bot-token.sh` in your own infra checkout terminal,
   commit the encrypted `Pulumi.platform.yaml` change, then preview/apply the
   targeted Function App update. See
   [infra setup instructions](https://github.com/hgahub/duumbi-infra/blob/main/docs/slack-bot-token.md).
   The GitHub secret alone does not configure Azure, and manual-only settings
   are overwritten by Pulumi's complete app-settings list.
2. Merge this PR. **Slack Bridge Deployment** tests and publishes the code on
   main, subject to the existing `production` environment approval rules.
3. Wait for deployment success. The Slack interactivity URL remains unchanged;
   `views.open` requires no additional OAuth scope.
4. Smoke-test with a disposable issue carrying `needs-human-review`: cancel a
   form (no decision), submit clarification (owner/question recorded), then
   Accept (clarification label removed). On a second disposable issue, Reject
   should record the rationale and close it. Verify the Project status and Slack
   result, not only the modal acknowledgement.

Without the Azure bot token, these two buttons fail closed with a visible setup
message; manual workflow dispatch remains available. Stages 7/9/10 and Project
Status keep their existing behavior.

### Developer-selected Inbox intake

The same signed endpoint also handles `/duumbi-triage <intake_id>`, dispatching
`intake-stage5` to the source repository. The command selects a ready Inbox note for
Stage 5; it does not accept or implement it. See
[activation, permissions and retry behavior](../../docs/automation/targeted-intake-stage5.md).
No new Azure settings or secrets are introduced.
